<h2 class="article-title">Insects and Water: Aquatic Larvae and Semi-Aquatic Species</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            Freshwater ecosystems—streams, ponds, wetlands, and even temporary pools—support diverse insect communities
            whose larvae develop underwater while adults emerge to fly and reproduce. These aquatic insects are critical
            indicators of water quality and essential food sources for fish, birds, and other wildlife across North
            America.
        </p>
                <h3 class="section-title">Major Aquatic Insect Groups</h3>
        <p>
            Mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies are among the most sensitive to water pollution, making them valuable
            bioindicators. Their presence indicates clean, well-oxygenated water. Dragonflies and damselflies spend most
            of their lives as aquatic predators, while mosquitoes and black flies have aquatic larvae but are better known
            as adult pests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many aquatic insects have specialized adaptations: gills for extracting oxygen from water, streamlined bodies
            for swimming, and modified mouthparts for filter-feeding or predation. Some caddisfly larvae build protective
            cases from sand, pebbles, or plant material.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="section-title">Semi-Aquatic and Riparian Species</h3>
        <p>
            Riparian zones—the transition areas between water and land—support unique insect communities. Water striders
            skate on surface tension, while whirligig beetles swim in circles on the water surface. Many ground beetles
            and rove beetles hunt along stream banks, and some butterflies require specific wetland host plants for their
            caterpillars.
        </p>
        <p>
            These edge habitats are particularly vulnerable to development, pollution, and invasive species, making them
            important conservation priorities.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-title">Threats and Conservation</h3>
        <p>
            Aquatic insects face multiple threats: pollution from agricultural runoff and urban stormwater, habitat loss
            from dam construction and channelization, and climate change altering water temperature and flow patterns.
            Invasive species like zebra mussels can disrupt entire aquatic food webs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Monitoring aquatic insect communities through programs like StreamWatch helps track water quality and guide
            restoration efforts. Simple sampling with nets or kick-sampling can reveal the health of local waterways.
        </p>
                <div class="tip-box">
            <div class="tip-title">Field Note</div>
            <p>
                Visit a local stream or pond and gently sweep a fine-mesh net through the water or along submerged
                vegetation. Examine what you catch in a shallow white pan with a hand lens. Look for mayfly nymphs with
                three tail filaments, dragonfly nymphs with extendable mouthparts, and caddisfly cases. Document your
                findings and return specimens to the water unharmed.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="conclusion">
            Aquatic insects connect freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, transferring energy from algae and detritus to
            land-based predators. Protecting water quality and maintaining healthy riparian zones ensures these essential
            insects continue to thrive and support broader ecosystem health.
