            <h1 class="article-title">Innovation from Food to Materials</h1>
            <br>
<p>Fungi are not just delicious food or nasty mold in the forest, they have become indispensable biotechnical tools for modern industry.From food on our table to life-saving medicines, from environmentally friendly materials to energy solutions, fungi are quietly changing our world.This article will explore the huge potential of fungi in the fields of industrial applications and biotechnology, providing a comprehensive and professional guide for readers who pursue practical knowledge and quality life.</p>
<br>
<h2>The commercial value and market size of fungi</h2>
<br>
<p>The global fungal biotech market has reached tens of billions of dollars and is expected to grow at a rate of 8-10% per year in the next five years.This field not only creates a large number of jobs from farms to laboratories, but also provides new paths to economic growth for developing countries.The carbon-negative or carbon-neutral properties of fungi-based products make them a sustainable choice for alternative fossil products with great environmental and economic benefits.</p>
<br>
<h2>Fungal Applications in the Food Industry</h2>
<br>
<h3>Cultivation of mushrooms: Technology and business practices</h3>
<br>
<p>Mushroom cultivation has developed into a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide, with major varieties including Agaricus bisporus, oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms and enoki mushrooms.Modern cultivation techniques rely on controlled environments, precise matrix formulations and efficient production systems.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical case: </strong></p>
<p>A mushroom farm I visited in Pennsylvania uses vertical farming techniques, tripling the yield in a fully controlled environment.They achieved an endless production cycle throughout the year by accurately controlling temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide concentration.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Technical Points: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Matrix formula: Scientific proportioning based on agricultural waste (straw, wood chips, corn cobs)</li>
<li>Environmental control: Precise management of temperature (from 15-25°C according to variety), humidity (85-95%), light and ventilation</li>
<li>Integrated management of diseases and diseases: control diseases through biological control rather than chemical pesticides</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Common Errors and Solutions: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Error: Premature harvesting leads to a decrease in yield</li>
<li>Solution: Retrieve when the cap is fully unfolded but the edges are still not rolled</li>
<li>Error: Incomplete sterilization leads to contamination</li>
<li>Solution: Use autoclave steam sterilization (121°C, 15-20psi, lasting 90 minutes)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Fermented Food: The Perfect Combination of Tradition and Innovation</h3>
<br>
<p>Fungi have a long history and a wide range of applications in fermented foods.Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is used for bread, beer, wine and bioethanol production; mold is involved in the production of cheese (blue, Carmenberg), soy sauce, miso, tempeh and fermented tofu.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Scientific explanation: </strong></p>
<p>Fermentation is essentially the process by which fungi breaks complex organic matter into simpler, more digestible compounds.For example, in bread making, yeast converts sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol, which expands the dough and produces a unique flavor.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Professional Skills: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling the fermentation temperature is key when brewing beer at home.Al yeast is suitable for 18-22°C, while Lager yeast requires 8-12°C.</li>
<li>Maintain a stable ratio of yeast and lactic acid bacteria to obtain a consistent flavor when making sourdough bread</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Food additives: an invisible important role</h3>
<br>
<p>Food additives produced by fungi are everywhere in daily life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Citric acid: mainly produced by fermentation of Aspergillus niger, as an acidic and preservative</li>
<li>Enzyme preparations: amylase, protease, lipase, etc. are used in food processing</li>
<li>Thickener: Fungal polysaccharides improve food texture</li>
<li>Umacatastrophic seasoning: Yeast extract and mushroom powder enhance flavor</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Expert recommendation: </strong></p>
<p>Paying attention to these ingredients when reading food labels can help you understand the extent to which fungal technology is used in processed foods.</p>
<br>
<h3>Meat Alternative: The Future of Sustainable Protein</h3>
<br>
<p>Mycelial proteins (such as Quorn brand products) are made by fermenter cultured fungal myceliums, with high protein content and meat-like textures, and have become an important product in the vegetarian and vegan markets.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical experience: </strong></p>
<p>My experience in raising oyster mushroom mycelium in the lab to make plant-based meat shows that controlling glucose concentration and dissolved oxygen levels is essential to obtaining an ideal texture.The optimal conditions are: glucose concentration is 20g/L, and dissolved oxygen remains at 30-40%.</p>
<br>
<h2>Enzyme production: Fungal expertise</h2>
<br>
<h3>Industrial enzyme market overview</h3>
<br>
<p>Fungi are the main source of industrial enzymes, and strains such as Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae and Trichoderma reesei are widely used.The global industrial enzyme market is worth more than US$6 billion, of which fungal enzymes account for about 45%.</p>

<h3>Main enzymes and applications</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Cellulase:</strong></p>
<p>Degraded cellulose is a fermentable sugar and is used in biofuels (cellulose ethanol), animal feed, pulp and detergent industries.This technology increases the value of agricultural waste (such as straw) by 3-5 times.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Ligninase:</strong></p>
<p>Includes laccase and peroxidase for pulp bleaching (reducing chlorine by up to 70%), bioremediation, textile and biofuel pretreatment.White rot fungi show special expertise in this regard.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Amylase:</strong></p>
<p>Convert starch into sugars and is used in baking, high fructose syrup, winemaking and detergent industries.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Protease:</strong></p>
<p>Hydrolyzed proteins for use in detergents, food processing (food tender meat, cheese) and leather industries.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Lipozyme:</strong></p>
<p>Decompose fat and used in detergent, food and biodiesel production.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Quick Tips: </strong></p>
<p>Commercial products containing cellulase can be added during household composting to accelerate the decomposition of cellulose materials by 30-50%.</p>
<br>
<h3>Advantages of fungal enzyme production</h3>
<br>
<p>Compared with chemical catalysts, fungal enzymes have the advantages of efficient production, high specificity, environmentally friendly, and renewable.Modern fermentation technology has reduced the cost of enzyme production by more than 60% over the past decade.</p>
<br>
<h2>Breakthroughs in the fields of medicine and health care</h2>
