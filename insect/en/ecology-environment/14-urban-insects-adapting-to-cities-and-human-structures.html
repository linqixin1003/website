        <p class="intro">
            Cities create novel environments—warmer microclimates, fragmented green spaces, artificial lights, and abundant
            food waste—that select for insects with flexible behaviors and broad diets. From pavement ants nesting in sidewalk
            cracks to monarch butterflies overwintering in California coastal cities, urban insects reveal rapid evolutionary
            responses to human-altered landscapes across the United States.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_dd30afaa_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Urban Adaptations and Success Stories</h3>
        <p>
            Some insects thrive in cities by exploiting human resources. German cockroaches and house flies evolved alongside
            human settlements, while native species like the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) adapt to urban
            gardens and parks. Urban heat islands allow southern species like the brown marmorated stink bug to expand
            northward, while light pollution disrupts nocturnal navigation for moths and fireflies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Green infrastructure—rooftop gardens, rain gardens, and urban forests—creates corridors that support both
            native and introduced pollinators. Monitoring these spaces helps researchers understand which species benefit
            from urbanization and which decline.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_dd30afaa_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
            Urban environments pose unique challenges: pesticide use in gardens, habitat fragmentation, and competition from
            invasive species. However, cities also offer opportunities for conservation. Community gardens, native plant
            installations, and reduced mowing schedules can support diverse insect communities even in dense metropolitan
            areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Citizen science projects like iNaturalist and eButterfly track urban insect diversity, revealing how species
            composition shifts with land use intensity and management practices.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_dd30afaa_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Observing Urban Insects</h3>
        <p>
            Start by documenting insects in your own neighborhood: check window sills for dead specimens, examine street
            trees for galls and leaf miners, and visit community gardens to observe pollinators. Note which species appear
            in highly developed areas versus parks or green corridors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Urban insect studies contribute to understanding how biodiversity responds to global urbanization, providing
            insights for designing more insect-friendly cities.

            <div class="tip-title">Field Note</div>
            <p>
                Create a simple transect: walk from a busy street through a park to a residential area, recording all insects
                you encounter. Compare diversity and abundance across these zones. Your observations can inform local
                conservation planning and urban design decisions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="conclusion">
            Urban insects demonstrate remarkable resilience and adaptation. By studying them, we learn how to create cities
            that support both human needs and insect biodiversity, ensuring that essential ecosystem services like pollination
            and decomposition continue in our most densely populated areas.
