        <p class="intro">
            Beneath your feet and above your head, insects occupy microhabitats—small-scale environments that offer
            shelter, food, and specific microclimates. Leaf litter, tree bark, galls, and dead wood host specialized
            communities that are often overlooked but critical to ecosystem function. Exploring these hidden worlds
            reveals incredible diversity and intricate ecological relationships.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_ad9eddac_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Leaf Litter: The Forest Floor Community</h3>
        <p>
            Decaying leaves create a complex habitat with distinct layers: fresh litter on top, partially decomposed
            material in the middle, and humus near the soil. Each layer supports different insects. Springtails and mites
            process organic matter, while ground beetles hunt smaller invertebrates. Many butterfly and moth larvae
            overwinter in leaf litter, emerging in spring to feed on new foliage.
        </p>
        <p>
            In eastern deciduous forests, leaf litter depth and composition vary with tree species, creating patchy
            microhabitats that support diverse insect assemblages. Disturbances like raking or removal reduce this
            diversity significantly.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_ad9eddac_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Bark and Dead Wood: Specialized Niches</h3>
        <p>
            Tree bark provides refuge for overwintering insects, while dead and dying trees host entire communities of
            wood-boring beetles, bark beetles, and their predators. Some species are specialists, requiring specific tree
            species or decay stages. The emerald ash borer, for example, attacks only ash trees, while many native
            beetles prefer oaks or pines at particular stages of decomposition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Retaining dead wood—standing snags and fallen logs—in forests and parks maintains these microhabitats and
            supports rare species that depend on decaying wood.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_ad9eddac_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Galls, Mines, and Other Plant Structures</h3>
        <p>
            Many insects create or inhabit specialized plant structures. Gall wasps and midges induce plants to form
            abnormal growths that provide food and shelter for developing larvae. Leaf miners tunnel between leaf layers,
            leaving distinctive patterns. These microhabitats are highly specific: each insect species typically targets
            particular plant species or even specific plant parts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examining galls and leaf mines provides a window into these intimate plant-insect relationships and helps
            identify both the insects and their host plants.

            <p>
                Try a simple microhabitat survey: gently sift through leaf litter with your hands or a small sieve,
                examine bark crevices with a hand lens, and look for galls on oak leaves or stems. Document what you find
                with photos and notes. You'll be amazed at the diversity hidden in these small spaces.
            </p>

        <p class="conclusion">
            Microhabitats remind us that insect diversity exists at every scale, from vast landscapes to tiny spaces
            between leaves. Protecting these microhabitats—by leaving leaf litter, retaining dead wood, and preserving
            native plant diversity—is essential for maintaining healthy insect communities.
