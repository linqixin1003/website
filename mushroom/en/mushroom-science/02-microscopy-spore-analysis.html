<p>Mushroom identification under a microscope is not only a science, but also an art.For outdoor enthusiasts who take mushroom collection seriously, mastering micro identification technology means accurately identifying edible species from similar species and avoiding potential dangers.This article will explore in-depth how to improve your mushroom identification skills through microscopic features.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why micro identification is crucial</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Limitations of macro identification</strong></p>
<br>
<p>In the wild, many mushroom species look extremely similar, but their edible and toxicity can vary greatly.Taking the genus Amanita as an example, some deadly poisonous mushrooms are almost indistinguishable from edible species in macroscopic manner.Micro features provide an undisputed basis for identification, especially for those species with similar appearances.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical case: Amanita identification challenge</strong></p>
<br>
<p>I once encountered a typical case in the Pacific Northwest of the United States: two experienced collectors have a disagreement over whether a white mushroom is edible.Macroscopic, it looks like an edible Amanita lanei, but spore analysis under microscope shows that it is actually a fatal angel mushroom (Amanita bisporigera).This example vividly illustrates how microscopic identification saves lives.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Scientific basis</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Fungal taxonomy is increasingly dependent on microscopic features.Spore morphology, cystic structure and mycelial characteristics provide reliable taxonomic data that are relatively stable and not affected by environmental factors.</p>
<br>
<h2>Professional Equipment Guide: Build Your Fungal Laboratory</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Microscopy selection strategy</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Composite optical microscopes are the core tool, and the magnification should be in the range of 400-1000 times.For beginners, I recommend entry-level biomicroscopes, which cost between $300-500 to meet basic needs.More professional research may require more than $2,000 models, equipped with oil mirrors and more advanced optical systems.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Expert recommendation: </strong> Find models with ABE condenser and mechanical stage, which are extremely important when observing tiny structures.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Essential Accessories List</strong></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Slides and coverslips: Prepare multiple thicknesses (No.1 and No.1.5) to suit different microscopes</li>
<li>Stainant set: including Melzer reagent, Congo red, 5% KOH solution</li>
<li>Eyepiece micrometer: used to accurately measure spore size</li>
<li>Anatomical tools: anatomical needles, sharp blades (surgery blades are the best)</li>
<li>Laboratory notebook: record observation results in detail</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Quick Tips: </strong> You don't need to buy all professional equipment at the beginning, and the basic configuration is enough to identify most common mushrooms.</p>
<br>
<h2>Spore printing production: the combination of science and art</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Optimized spore printing technology</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Spore printing not only provides spore color information, but also obtains a large number of spores for microscopy observation.Traditional improvements include:</p>
<br>
<p>1. Choose a mature but not fully expanded cover</p>
<p>2. Use half-white and half-black paper to facilitate observation of spores of various colors</p>
<p>3. Cover the glass bowl to prevent air drying, but leave small gaps to allow moderate air circulation</p>
<p>4. Leave it at room temperature for 6-24 hours, the specific time depends on the mushroom type</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical skills: </strong> For species that are difficult to produce spores, try to increase humidity in the container, or place the bacterial cap on aluminum foil instead of paper to facilitate subsequent collection of spores.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Classification of spore color</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Spore color is an important indicator of mushroom classification:</p>
<ul>
<li>White: Common colors of Amanita, Russula, etc.</li>
<li>Pink: Pluteus's characteristic color</li>
<li>Brown: Including various shades, it is the characteristic of many porous bacteria</li>
<li>Purple-brown: Typical colors of Psilocybe</li>
<li>Black: Characteristics of genus Coprinus and other genus</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Experts recommend: </strong> Observe the spore color under natural light, artificial light sources may change color perception.</p>
<br>
<h2>Spore observation: from sample to data</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Professional sampling technology</strong></p>
<br>
<p>When sampling from spore printing, gently dip the spores using a wet dissection needle tip.If sampling directly from the bacterial folds, carefully scrape a small amount of spores without destroying the bacterial fold structure.For porous bacteria, samples were taken from the wells of the tube.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Picture optimization method</strong></p>
<br>
<p>1. Add a small drop of distilled water or 5% KOH solution in the center of the slide</p>
<p>2. Gently disperse the spore sample in the droplets</p>
<p>3. Slowly lower the coverslip at an angle of about 45 degrees to avoid bubbles</p>
<p>4. Use a tissue to suck off excess liquid</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Common errors: </strong> Using too many samples can lead to too thick cell layers and difficult to focus.Sparse samples usually provide clearer observations.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>System Observation Process</strong></p>
<br>
<p>1. Use a low-power mirror (100x) to locate the sample and general structure first</p>
<p>2. Switch to high power mirror (400x) to observe details</p>
<p>3. Use an oil mirror (1000x) to observe the fine structures such as spore surface patterns and other aspects.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Spore characteristics analysis</strong></p>
<br>
<p><strong>Shape classification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spherical: Completely round, such as some Amanita species</li>
<li>Oval: aspect ratio is about 1.5:1, commonly found in many tomato worms</li>
<li>Cylindrical: The length is significantly larger than the width</li>
<li>Almond shape: pointed at both ends, wide in the middle</li>
<li>Spindle: wide in the middle, thin at both ends</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Precise measurement technology</strong></p>
<br>
<p>20-30 mature spores were measured using a calibrated eyepiece microscope, and length and width were recorded.Calculate the mean and range to exclude spores that are significantly immature or deformed.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Professional Tips: </strong> The size of the spore also varies within the same species. Measurement of multiple spores can obtain more accurate data.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Surface pattern identification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smooth: no protrusions on the surface</li>
<li>Wart-like: irregular wart-like protrusions</li>
<li>Pierced: with spiked protrusions</li>
<li>Reticular pattern: with reticular pattern</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Special structure observation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bud pore: thin area on the spore wall, breaking from here when germination</li>
<li>Oil droplets: storage substances in spores, which have identification value in certain types</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Cystosome: Neglected identification key</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Detailed explanation of the cystic body type</strong></p>
<br>
<p>The cystic body is a specialized cell on the edges or sides of the bacterial frills, with extremely diverse morphology:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Pleurocystidia: located on the side of the bacterial folds, with various shapes</li>
<li>Cheilocystidia: located at the edge of bacterial frills, which is crucial for the identification of many genera</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical application: </strong> The identification of the genus Psilocybe is extremely dependent on the characteristics of the capsule, and correct identification may be related to legal and safety issues.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Optimization of observation method</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Preparing thin sections of bacterial folds requires practice and patience:</p>
<p>1. Cut a small piece of bacteria with a sharp blade</p>
<p>2. Place it on the slide and gently separate it with a dissection needle</p>
<p>3. Add appropriate medium (water or KOH)</p>
<p>4. Cover the coverslip and press gently to make the sample thin.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Experts recommend: </strong> Use double-sided blades to prepare thinner slices to improve observation quality.</p>
<br>
<h2>Mycelium structure: the root of fungi</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Myhypha type identification</strong></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Reproductive mycelium: There is a diaphragm, which may have a locked joint, responsible for spore production</li>
<li>Skeleton mycelium: thick walls, providing structural support</li>
<li>Combined with mycelium: thin wall, plays a connection function</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>The importance of lock-shaped union</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Cloned combination is a characteristic structure of certain bacidioids, manifested as a small loop at the junction of cells.Its presence or absence is an important classification feature.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Observation techniques: </strong>Tear extremely thin tissue sheets from the inside of the cap or stalk and place them in KOH solution to observe.</p>
<br>
<h2>Melzer reaction: chemical identification method</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Melzer Reagent Application Guide</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Melzer reagent (potassium iodide-iodine solution) is used to detect starch reaction:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Starchy reaction: dark blue or purple black</li>
<li>Non-starchy reaction: turn yellowish or unchanged</li>
<li>Starchy-like reaction: turn reddish-brown</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical Application</strong></p>
<br>
<p>The identification of the genus Russula and Lactarius relies heavily on the Melzer response.For example, most species of the genus Russula spores react in starchy, while the spores of Lactarius are usually non-starchy.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Safety Tips: </strong> Melzer reagent is toxic, wear gloves during operation and perform in a well-ventilated place.</p>
<br>
<h2>The epidermal structure of the cap: the secret of the surface</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Epidermal Type Classification</strong></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Wax quilt (ixocutis): Gluten layer covering</li>
<li>Trichoderm: composed of erect mycelium</li>
<li>Palisadoderm: vertical arrangement of cells</li>
<li>Epithelium: consists of spherical or elliptical cells</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Observation method</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Cut the slices from the edge of the cap and try to include the surface layer and a small amount of underlying tissue.For the colloidal layer, KOH may be required to help clean.</p>
<br>
<h2>Professional microscopy technology essence</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Perfect seven-step method for production</strong></p>
<br>
<p>1. Clean the slides and coverslips</p>
<p>2. Select the right medium (water, KOH or other)</p>
<p>3. Sample and distribute appropriately</p>
<p>4. Carefully cover the coverslip</p>
<p>5. Remove bubbles (tap the coverslip)</p>
<p>6. Suck off excess liquid</p>
<p>7. Seal from the edge (for long-term storage)</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Dyeing technology optimization</strong></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Congo Red: Enhance the visibility of mycelium and spore walls</li>
<li>Cotton blue: especially suitable for observing fine patterns</li>
<li>Melzer Reagent: Directly used in spores or tissues</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Expert tips: </strong> For difficult-to-dye structures, try to clean them with KOH first, and then apply a dye.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Precise measurement protocol</strong></p>
<br>
<p>1. Calibrate the micrometer before each use</p>
<p>2. Measure spores in multiple fields of view</p>
<p>3. Record maximum, minimum and average values</p>
<p>4. Pay attention to measurement conditions (media, magnification)</p>
<br>
<h2>Records and Documentation: Application of Scientific Methods</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>System Record Template</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Create standardized record forms, including:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Digital Tools Application</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Image analysis software was used to measure spore sizes and observe records using database management.Platforms such as iNaturalist and Mushroom Observer can share discoveries and communicate with experts.</p>
<br>
<h2>Common Challenges and Solutions</h2>
<br>
<p><strong> Focus on difficulties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reason: The sample is too thick</li>
<li>Solution: Prepare thinner slices, adjust the condenser</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Bubble Problem</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prevention: Slowly lower the coverslip at an angle</li>
<li>Solution: Tap the coverslip or use the needle tip to guide the bubbles to escape</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Sparse spores</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy: Take samples from different parts multiple times</li>
<li>Tips: Use spore printing instead of direct sampling</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Inconsistent measurement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improvement: Increase the number of measurements (more than 30)</li>
<li>Standardization: Fixed measurement conditions and methods</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Advanced Technology Outlook</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>Scanning electron microscope (SEM)</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Provides amazing surface details, but are expensive and requires professional preparation.A university or research institution may provide paid services.</p>
