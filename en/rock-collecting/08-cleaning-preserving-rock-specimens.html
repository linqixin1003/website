            <h2>Pre-Cleaning Preparation</h2>
            <p>Before cleaning any rock or mineral specimen, take these important steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify the Specimen</strong> - Different rocks and minerals require different cleaning methods. Some are delicate and can be damaged by water or chemicals.</li>
                <li><strong>Assess the Condition</strong> - Check for cracks, loose crystals, or other weaknesses that might be worsened by cleaning.</li>
                <li><strong>Gather Supplies</strong> - Have all necessary cleaning supplies ready before you begin.</li>
                <li><strong>Test a Small Area</strong> - If you're unsure about a cleaning method, test it on a small, inconspicuous area first.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="cleaning-methods">
            <h2>Cleaning Methods for Different Rock Types</h2>
            <p>The best cleaning method depends on the type of rock or mineral you're working with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dry Cleaning</strong> - For delicate specimens, use a soft brush, compressed air, or a dry cloth to remove loose dirt and debris.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Washing</strong> - For most hard rocks, gently washing with warm water and a soft brush is safe. Avoid using hot water, which can cause thermal shock.</li>
                <li><strong>Mild Detergent</strong> - For more stubborn dirt, use a small amount of mild dish soap in warm water. Rinse thoroughly to remove all soap residue.</li>
                <li><strong>Ultrasonic Cleaning</strong> - For small, hard specimens, an ultrasonic cleaner can be effective. However, this method is not suitable for fragile or porous materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemical Cleaning</strong> - For specific minerals, chemicals like hydrochloric acid (for carbonates) or oxalic acid (for iron stains) may be used. This should only be done by experienced collectors with proper safety equipment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="special-techniques">
            <h2>Special Cleaning Techniques</h2>
            <p>Some specimens require special care:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fossils</strong> - Use a soft brush and distilled water. Avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the fossil material.</li>
                <li><strong>Crystals</strong> - Handle with care to avoid chipping. Use a soft brush and mild detergent solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Stones with Metal Inclusions</strong> - Avoid acidic cleaners that could damage the metal.</li>
                <li><strong>Porous Rocks</strong> - Be careful not to saturate porous rocks with water, which can cause discoloration or damage.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="drying-and-preservation">
            <h2>Drying and Preservation</h2>
            <p>After cleaning, proper drying and preservation are crucial:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Air Drying</strong> - Allow specimens to air dry completely in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight, which can cause fading.</li>
                <li><strong>Drying Chambers</strong> - For delicate specimens, use a desiccation chamber with silica gel to remove moisture slowly.</li>
                <li><strong>Sealing</strong> - Some specimens benefit from a light coating of mineral oil or clear acrylic spray to enhance their appearance and protect them from moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Labeling</strong> - Once dry, label specimens with important information like name, location, and date collected.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="long-term-storage">
            <h2>Long-Term Storage</h2>
            <p>Proper storage is essential for preserving your collection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environment</strong> - Store specimens in a cool, dry place with stable temperature and humidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Containers</strong> - Use acid-free boxes, trays, or display cases to protect specimens from dust and damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Separation</strong> - Store specimens separately to prevent scratching or chemical reactions between different minerals.</li>
                <li><strong>Handling</strong> - Handle specimens with clean hands or gloves to avoid transferring oils and dirt.</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance</strong> - For valuable collections, consider obtaining insurance to protect against loss, theft, or damage.</li>
            </ul>
