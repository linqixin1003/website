        <p class="intro">
            Most insects follow one of two development plans. In complete metamorphosis, larvae and adults look and live
            very differently, as in butterflies and beetles. In incomplete metamorphosis, juveniles resemble miniature
            adults, as in grasshoppers and true bugs. Recognizing these patterns helps you predict where to search for
            each stage and how it fits into local food webs.

        <p>
            Insects with complete metamorphosis (holometabolous insects) include butterflies, moths, beetles, flies,
            bees, wasps, and ants. Larvae are dedicated feeding machines—caterpillars on milkweed, beetle grubs in soil,
            maggots in decaying matter. After reaching a critical size, they enter a pupal stage during which tissues are
            reorganized into the adult form.
        </p>
        <p>
            This separation of life stages allows larvae and adults to occupy different niches. A monarch caterpillar
            feeds exclusively on milkweed leaves, while the adult butterfly nectar-feeds on many flower species, spreading
            pollen across the landscape.

        <p>
            Insects with incomplete metamorphosis (hemimetabolous insects) include grasshoppers, crickets, cockroaches,
            true bugs, and dragonflies. Nymphs resemble small, wingless adults and gradually gain wings and reproductive
            organs through a series of molts. They often share the same habitat and diet as adults, which simplifies
            their ecology but can intensify competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            In ponds, dragonfly nymphs are aquatic predators, while adults become aerial hunters. In contrast, many
            terrestrial nymphs, such as leaf-footed bugs, feed on the same host plants as the adults you see later in
            the season.

            <div class="tip-title">Field Note</div>
            <p>
                When you encounter an unfamiliar insect, ask: does any juvenile form look dramatically different from the
                adult? Keeping photo series of insects across seasons can reveal whether you are seeing larvae + adults
                (complete metamorphosis) or a series of nymphal stages (incomplete metamorphosis).
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="conclusion">
            Understanding metamorphosis helps you time surveys, protect vulnerable stages, and interpret seasonal
            changes in insect abundance. This knowledge is key for both conservation planning and practical pest
            management on farms, in gardens, and in restored prairies.
