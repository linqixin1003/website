        <p class="intro">
            Forests, grasslands, and wetlands each host characteristic insect communities shaped by vegetation, moisture,
            and microclimate. Learning which groups dominate in each habitat helps you interpret what you see during hikes
            in national parks, prairie preserves, or neighborhood greenways.

        <p>
            In forests, insects occupy vertical layers. Canopy‑dwelling caterpillars feed on leaves, bark beetles tunnel
            beneath tree bark, and ground beetles patrol the leaf litter. Many beetles and wasps depend on dead wood,
            while ants build complex nests in soil or rotting logs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Old‑growth and mixed‑age forests in the Pacific Northwest or Appalachians typically support more specialized
            insect fauna than recently logged stands or monoculture tree plantations.

        <p>
            Tallgrass prairies and shortgrass steppes are dominated by sun‑loving plants and open ground. Grasshoppers,
            leafhoppers, pollinating bees, and predatory robber flies are especially prominent. Many species are adapted
            to frequent disturbance from fire or grazing; some rely on specific native grasses or forbs that disappear
            when fields are converted to intensive agriculture.
        </p>
        <p>
            In restored prairies, monitoring insect diversity is one way to gauge whether plantings are providing genuine
            habitat rather than just visual resemblance.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_e49f72df_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Wetlands: Aquatic and Semi‑Aquatic Specialists</h3>
        <p>
            Wetlands support insects with complex life cycles that bridge water and land. Dragonflies and damselflies
            spend most of their lives as aquatic nymphs before emerging as aerial adults. Mosquitoes, midges, and many
            beetles also rely on standing water for larval development, while adult stages may feed on nectar, other
            insects, or vertebrate blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because many wetland insects are sensitive to pollution and hydrological change, they serve as important
            bioindicators for water quality and habitat integrity.

            <p>
                When visiting a new site, take five minutes to list visible habitat features—tree cover, ground vegetation,
                standing water, soil moisture. Then predict which insect groups you expect to find. Comparing your predictions
                with actual observations is an excellent way to refine your understanding of habitat–insect relationships.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="conclusion">
            By recognizing how insect communities differ among forests, grasslands, and wetlands, you can better interpret
            changes over time, identify conservation priorities, and design land‑management practices that support a full
            spectrum of biodiversity.
