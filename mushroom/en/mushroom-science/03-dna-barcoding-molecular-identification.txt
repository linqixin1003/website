# DNA barcode technology: a revolutionary breakthrough in modern fungal identification

## Why DNA identification is changing mycologics

When I first identified mushrooms in a forest with a hand-held DNA sequencer, I realized that the game rules of mycologic have completely changed.Traditionally, we rely on morphological characteristics—colour of the cap, spacing of the folds, and morphology of the ring—those methods require years of experience and subjective judgment.Now, DNA barcode technology allows any enthusiast who is serious about learning to achieve the accuracy of identification close to that of experts.

The concept of DNA barcode is similar to supermarket commodity scanning: identifying species by analyzing sequences in specific regions of biological DNA.For fungi, the internationally recognized standard barcode region is ITS (internal transcriptional spacer).This technology not only solves the problem that has plagued mycologists for decades, but also provides unprecedentedly accurate tools for field collectors, chefs and researchers.

## The scientific basis of DNA barcode: Why choose the ITS region?

### Technical details of the ITS area

ITS is located between the 18S-5.8S-28S gene of ribosomal DNA and contains two spacers: ITS1 and ITS2.Selecting ITS as the fungal standard barcode region is based on four key advantages:

**Ideal Variation**: The ITS region has a large enough difference between species to distinguish between relative species, while the intraspecies variation is relatively small, ensuring that the individual sequences of the same species are basically consistent.Actual data show that the ITS region varies between species by 3-15% in most fungal populations, while intraspecies variation is usually less than 1-2%.

**General Primers**: Researchers have developed multiple pairs of universal primers (such as ITS1/ITS4, ITS5/ITS4) that can amplify the ITS regions of the vast majority of fungal populations without the need to design specific primers for each species.

**Domain rich**: Mycologists around the world have jointly built databases containing millions of ITS sequences, such as UNITE, GenBank and BOLD systems, providing a solid foundation for comparison and identification.

**Easy to amplify**: The ITS region has a moderate length (usually 500-700 base pairs), and the PCR amplification success rate is high, and available sequences can be obtained even from degraded samples.

### Practical case: Breakthrough in identification of Amanita in North America

In the Pacific Northwest, collectors used a white amanita as an edible species for many years until the DNA barcode revealed that it was actually a new species close to the death cap (Amanita phalloides).This discovery may have prevented numerous poisoning incidents.Through ITS sequence analysis, the researchers found that this mushroom was 8.7% different from the known edible Amanita, which was much higher than the species-grade distinction threshold (usually 3%).

## Complete guide to DNA barcode

### Sample collection: From the field to the laboratory

**Collection tool preparation**:
- Sterile gloves (prevent cross contamination)
- Sterile sampling bag or paper bag
- Portable refrigerator (maintaining DNA integrity)
- GPS equipment (precisely position the acquisition point)
- Digital camera (records macro features in detail)
- On-site record book (record habitat, host, odor, etc.)

**Experts recommend**: Be sure to keep the complete fruiting body during collection, including the base of the stem – many key identification features are located here.Ideally, individuals from multiple developmental stages are collected, never opening an umbrella until they are fully mature.

**Sample saving method**:
- Silicone gel drying method: put fresh samples in a sealed container and mix them with silicone particles, and completely dry within 48 hours
-Cryo-storage: -20°C for long-term storage, -80°C best
- Ethanol preservation: 95% ethanol is suitable for molecular research, but it will destroy morphological characteristics

### DNA extraction: a key step in high-quality samples

**Basic Home Laboratory Program**:
1. Take 50-100mg of dried bacterial cap tissue and grind it into fine powder with liquid nitrogen.
2. Add CTAB extraction buffer and bathe in 65°C for 30 minutes
3. Chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction to remove protein
4. Isopropanol precipitates DNA
5. Washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in TE buffer

**Commercial kit selection**: For beginners, it is recommended to use Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kit or MP Biomedicals FastDNA SPIN Kit, with a success rate of up to 95%, and the whole process only takes 1-2 hours.

**Common error avoidance**:
- Avoid using stale or degraded samples
- Prevent exogenous DNA contamination (workbench, tool sterilization)
- Do not overdry and cause DNA breakage

### PCR amplification and sequencing: core technical steps

**Standard ITS amplification scheme**:
- Primer selection: ITS1F (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3')
- Reaction system: 25 μL total volume, containing about 10-50 ng template DNA
- Cycle conditions: 94°C predenaturation for 4 minutes; 35 cycles (94°C 30 seconds, 52°C 30 seconds, 72°C 45 seconds); 72°C final extension for 7 minutes

**Sequencing selection**:
- Sanger Sequencing: Single sample, cost about $10-15, turnaround time 1-3 days
- High-throughput sequencing: suitable for environmental samples or batch identification, cost depends on throughput

### Sequence analysis and identification: the art of data interpretation

**Basic Process**:
1. Sequence quality control: remove low-quality areas and ensure Q value >30
2. BLAST search: Comparison in NCBI or UNITE databases
3. Similarity Assessment: >97-99% Similarity usually indicates the same species
4. Phylogenetic analysis: Confirm the identification results by constructing evolution tree

**Practical skills**: Don’t blindly believe in the highest matching result.Check multiple high-matching sequences to see their origins and annotation quality.In UNITE databases, sequences with "Species Hypothesis" numbers are preferred, which are professionally annotated and have higher reliability.

## Main database and resource platform

### Professional database comparison

**UNITE database** (https://unite.ut.ee)
- Designed specifically for fungal ITS sequences
- Provides species assumption (SH) system to reduce error identification
- Recommended as the primary identification resource

**GenBank** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
- Comprehensive database containing all biological sequences
- The data volume is large but the quality is different, so you need to use it with caution
- Best effect in combination with BLAST tools

**BOLD system** (http://www.boldsystems.org)
- Designed specifically for DNA barcodes
- Integrate morphological and molecular data
- User-friendly interface, suitable for beginners

### Database usage policy

**Multi-database verification**: Important authentication should be confirmed in at least two independent databases.If UNITE and BOLD give the same results, the credibility is greatly improved.

**Evaluate sequence quality**:
- Check the sequence length (full ITS area should be >500bp)
- Confirm the credibility of the submitter (research organization vs unverified users)
- View relevant published literature support

## Beyond ITS: Application of Other Molecular Markers

### Auxiliary identification marking system

**LSU (Large Subunit Ribosomal RNA)**:
- Suitable for classification of classification units above the level
- The evolution rate is slow, suitable for distant relationship research
- Especially used for yeast and microfungal identification

**TEF1-α (translation extension factor)**:
- Higher species-level resolution in certain groups such as the Orchid Orchid
- Solve the problem of close relatives that ITS cannot distinguish
- Need group-specific primers

**RPB2 (second largest subunit of RNA polymerase)**:
- One of the preferred markers for phylogenetic research
- Provides different evolutionary signals from ITS
- Commonly used for classification system revision

### Multigene joint analysis

For difficult identification, combining multiple gene markers greatly improves accuracy.Standard multigene analysis includes ITS+LSU+RPB2+TEF1-α, and this combination has a success rate of nearly 100% in the distinction between relative species.

## Practical application scenarios

### Safety identification of edible mushrooms

**Case Study: North American Morel Complex**
Traditionally, North American collectors view all black morels as the same species.DNA barcode reveals that this is actually a complex of 12 different species, some of which have limited distribution ranges and collection stress may lead to local extinction.Responsible and professional collectors now conduct DNA validation of high-value species to ensure sustainable collection.

**Customer mushroom product authenticity verification**
Laboratory tests found that 30% of the "wild-collected" mushrooms on the market are actually cultivars.Using DNA barcodes, we are able to verify the authenticity of the vendor's statement.Especially suitable for high-value species such as matsutake, morel and chanterelles.

### Environmental DNA Monitoring

**Revolutionary Technology**: Extract total DNA from soil, water or air, analyze fungal community composition through high-throughput sequencing without culturing or observing fruit entities.

**Practical Application**:
- Monitoring changes in the distribution of endangered species

- Track the impact of climate change on fungal communities

**Outdoor Operation Guide**:
1. Collect 100-200g of surface soil (removal of leaf layer)
2. Use sterile tools to avoid cross-contamination
3. Refrigerate immediately or add storage buffer
4. Record accurate GPS coordinates and environmental parameters

### Application of Forensic Mycologics

In cases of poisonous mushroom poisoning, DNA analysis can identify species from vomit, cooking residues, and even the digestive system, providing key information for medical interventions.In a 2019 California poisoning incident, Amanita phalloides were identified from the contents of the stomach through DNA barcodes, and doctors were guided to use experimental antidotes to successfully save patients' lives.
