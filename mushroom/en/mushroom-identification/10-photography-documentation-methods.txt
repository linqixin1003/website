# Recording the fungus world with lenses: a complete guide to professional mushroom photography and scientific recording

## Introduction: Why Mushroom Photography deserves serious

When I first discovered a perfect poisonous fly Amanita in the ancient forests of the Pacific Northwest, that moment forever changed my understanding of mushroom photography.The bright red bulb cover is dotted with white scales, like a fairy tale scene – but as an experienced mycologist, I know that a "beautiful" photo is far from enough.Truly valuable mushroom photography must take into account both aesthetics and science, and must not only capture the beauty of nature, but also provide sufficient identification characteristics.

Over the past fifteen years, I have recorded over 500 mushroom species through lenses, providing thousands of scientific photos for academic research, and guiding countless beginners to avoid common pitfalls of photography recordings.This guide will share these experiences to help you create mushroom photography records that are both artistic and scientific.

## Multiple Values ​​of Photography Records: Practical Considerations Beyond Beauty

### Authentication Assistance: Your Visual Notebook

**Practical case: ** Last fall, I discovered an unfamiliar amanita in the redwood forest in Northern California.Through the seven angle photos taken by the system, I was able to work remotely with three experts and finally confirmed that this was a variant that has not been officially documented yet.Without those detailed photos, this discovery is almost impossible.

**Key Advantages: **
- Continue to identify after returning home: The field time is limited, and the photos allow you to study carefully at home
- Visual evidence from expert consultation: Clear pictures are better than thousands of words
- Reference materials comparison: Accurate comparison with illustrations or online resources

### Memory Assist: Make up for the shortcomings of human memory

Human memory is selective and distorted over time.I thought I clearly remembered the smell and texture of a mushroom, and I didn’t realize that my memory was biased until I compared the photos and notes.

**Scientific basis:** Research shows that people forget about 70% of the details of observation after 48 hours.Photos capture subtle features that you thought weren't important at the time but later found key.

### Scientific Value: Contributions of Citizen Scientists

**Professional Insights: ** With platforms like iNaturalist, photos of amateurs are changing mycology.In 2019, a photo of a Washington state hiker led to the discovery of a new bolete.Your records may have scientific value that you would not expect.

Specific contributions include:
- Species Distribution Record: Helps Track the Impact of Climate Change on Fungi
- Phenological data: record the occurrence time and duration of different species
- Potential new species discovery: Experts identify possible unknown species through photos

### Legal and security evidence: life-saving information at critical moments

**Real Story:** In 2018, a family in Colorado mistakenly ate poisonous mushrooms, and their photos helped the poison control center determine the species within minutes and guide the correct treatment.

On the legal level, clear photos can:
- Accurately identify the types of poisoning and guide medical treatment
- Providing evidence in foraging rights disputes
- Record the location and permissions for collection

## Eight must-have shooting angles: the key to complete recording

### 1. In-situ growth photos: The environment tells the story

**Why is crucial: **
Mushrooms are inseparable from their environment.Many species form mycorrhizal relationships with specific tree species, and growth matrix (soil, wood species) is the key clue for identification.

**Professional Skills: **
- Two steps back, including an environment of at least 1 meter square
- Capture the connection between mushrooms and substrate
- Contains surrounding vegetation and trees
- Record natural light conditions

**Common errors: ** Focusing too much on mushroom close-ups and ignoring the environmental background, losing ecological related information.

### 2. Top of the cap: The first impression of identity

**Key Feature Capture: **
- Cover shape: conical, convex, flat shape, etc.
- Color and Distribution: Pay attention to the color difference between center and edge
- Surface texture: sticky, smooth, dry, scales, etc.
- Edge characteristics: whether it is inclined, striped, etc.

**Shooting skills: **
- Shooting at 45 degrees, showing both the top and part of the sides
- Make sure the focus is clear from the center to the edge
- Use natural scattering light to avoid strong shadows

### 3. Bottom of the Cover: The Secret World of Spores

**Why is this one of the most important identification characteristics: **
Fungal folds, holes or tooth-like structures are the main basis for mushroom classification.Their color, density and attachment provide decisive evidence.

**Professional Method: **
- Gently tilt the mushrooms instead of flip them directly to avoid damage
- Reflect from below using a small mirror without touching
- Ensure clear display of how the tuck and stalk are connected
- Focus on the edge of the bacteria frills, where the characteristics are most obvious

### 4. Side profile: overall morphology

**Key information: **
- Cover section shape
- The morphology and proportion of stalks
- Position and characteristics of bacterial rings
- The proportional relationship of each part

**Photography suggestions: **
- Shooting on the same horizontal line as mushrooms
- Use a simple background to highlight the outline
- Ensure the entire side is in sharp focus

### 5. Stems and base: Hidden identification keys

**Experts suggest: ** This is the most often overlooked but often the most important angle.The identification characteristics of many lethal poisonous mushrooms are at the base.

**Features that must be captured: **
- Stomach surface texture: smooth, reticular, scales?
- Bacteria ring: location, color, whether it can be moved
- Bacteria: Existence or not, shape, color
- Base shape: whether it is enlarged or not, whether there are false roots

**Operation Guide: **
- Dig out the mushrooms intact but carefully, keeping the base intact
- Gently remove dirt, but retain key structure
- Close and clear base features

### 6. Vertical section: Revealing of internal structure

**Why Is indispensable: **
Internal color, texture and structure are the decisive characteristics of many genera, such as Lactobacillus.

**Professional Skills: **
- Use a sharp knife to make cleaning cut
- Take a photo now to record the initial color
- Wait for 5-15 minutes to record color changes
- Shoot on white background, enhance contrast
- Pay attention to whether the thickness of the mushroom meat and the stem are hollow

### 7. Scale Photo: The Importance of Size

**Scientific basis: ** Without reference objects, it is difficult for the human brain to accurately judge the size.The scale provides objective data.

**Best Practice: **
- Use ruler with centimeter/mm scale
- Coins can be used as alternatives, but the ruler is more professional
- Make sure the scale is on the same plane as the mushroom
- At least one photo contains clear scale

### 8. Spore printing: final identification evidence

**Professional Insights: ** Spore color is a decisive feature of identification in many genera, such as Amanita.

**Production and shooting guide: **
- Place the cap on half-white and half-black paper
- Cover the bowl or box to prevent airflow from disturbing
- Wait for 2-24 hours to obtain the complete spore printing
- Shoot in natural light to avoid flashing
- Contains tag information (date, place, number)
