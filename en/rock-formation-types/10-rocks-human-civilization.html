            <h1>Rocks and Human Civilization</h1>
            
            <p>Throughout human history, rocks and minerals have played a fundamental role in shaping civilization. From the earliest stone tools to modern skyscrapers, from ancient artwork to advanced electronics, rocks have been essential to human development. This article explores the profound relationship between rocks and human civilization, highlighting how these natural materials have influenced our culture, technology, and way of life.</p>

            <h2>The Stone Age: Foundation of Civilization</h2>
            
            <p>The Stone Age, which began approximately 2.6 million years ago, represents the first major period of human technological development. During this era, early humans relied almost exclusively on rocks and minerals for survival and advancement:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Paleolithic Period (Old Stone Age):</strong> Humans used simple stone tools like hand axes, scrapers, and choppers made from flint, quartzite, and other hard rocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Mesolithic Period (Middle Stone Age):</strong> saw the development of more sophisticated tools like microliths (small stone blades) and composite tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Neolithic Period (New Stone Age):</strong> brought revolutionary advances including polished stone tools, pottery, and the first permanent settlements built with stone and mud bricks.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Geothermal energy:</strong> Harnessing the Earth's heat through rocks for clean energy</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon capture and storage:</strong> Using rocks to store carbon dioxide and mitigate climate change</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The relationship between rocks and human civilization is profound and enduring. From our earliest tools to our most advanced technologies, rocks have shaped our development and continue to be essential to our way of life. As we face the challenges of the 21st century, our responsible stewardship of these finite resources will be crucial for sustainable development and the well-being of future generations. By understanding and respecting the geological processes that have created these resources, we can ensure that rocks continue to support human civilization for millennia to come.</p>
