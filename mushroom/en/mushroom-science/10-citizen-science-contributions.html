<h2>What is civic science?</h2>
<br>
<p>Citizen science refers to the process of public participation in scientific research. Non-professional scientists promote scientific progress by collecting data, analyzing information and even raising research questions.In the field of mycology, civic science has a long tradition—amateur mushroom lovers have made irreplaceable contributions to this discipline through centuries of observation and recording.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Expert Perspective</strong>: As a biologist who has been engaged in fungi research for more than 20 years, I can tell you clearly that at least one-third of the important discoveries of modern mycosm stem from the contributions of amateurs.From the discovery of new species to the recording of distribution ranges, the eyes and notebooks of citizen scientists have become important extensions of scientific exploration.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why is mycology particularly suitable for civic science?</h2>
<br>
<h3>High accessibility</h3>
<br>
<p>Mushrooms are found in almost every corner of the planet—from city parks to remote wilderness, from backyard lawns to dense forests.Unlike many other biological groups, you don’t need special permissions or expensive equipment to start observing and recording fungi.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical Case</strong>: I remember a retired Chicago teacher who recorded 87 different mushrooms in a year within three blocks near his home alone, including two species that were not recorded in the area at the time.</p>
<br>
<h3>Macrovisibility</h3>
<br>
<p>Unlike microorganisms that require a microscope to observe, most mushrooms are visible to the naked eye and have obvious characteristics.This visibility allows ordinary people to make meaningful observations and records.</p>
<br>
<h3>Amazing diversity</h3>
<br>
<p>There are more than 14,000 known mushroom species worldwide, and scientists estimate that this may only account for 20-30% of the actual total.This diversity means that hobbyists have a real opportunity to discover species that have not been documented in science.</p>
<br>
<h3>obvious seasonality</h3>
<br>
<p>The seasonal appearance pattern of mushrooms provides ideal conditions for long-term monitoring.Year after year records enable valuable data sets, especially in climate change research.</p>
<br>
<h3>Passionate support to the community</h3>
<br>
<p>Fungi lovers around the world form a passionate, knowledgeable and willing to share.Whether it is an online forum or a local fungus society, newcomers can find rich learning resources and guidance.</p>
<br>
<h3>Huge data demand</h3>
<br>
<p>Professional scientists cannot cover all geographical areas and all time points.Citizen scientists’ distributed observation network fills this critical gap.</p>
<br>
<h2>Major areas of contribution of citizen science in mycology</h2>
<br>
<h3>Species Distribution Data</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Core elements of observation record</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-quality photos (multiple angles)</li>
<li>Accurate GPS positioning</li>
<li>Specific date and time</li>
<li>Detailed habitat description</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Main Data Platform</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>iNaturalist: The world's largest bio-observation platform, user-friendly and powerful AI identification assistance</li>
<li>Mushroom Observer: a dedicated mushroom observation platform that provides more detailed data fields and a professional discussion community</li>
<li>Database of fungal societies in various regions</li>
<li>Emerging fungi-specific platforms such as FungiMap (Australia) and Danish Fungal Atlas</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Data Value and Application</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in geographical gaps in species distribution</li>
<li>Discover new distribution records</li>
<li>Track species range changes (such as migration with climate change)</li>
<li>Draw accurate species distribution maps</li>
<li>Regional Biodiversity Assessment</li>
<li>Identify protection priority areas and rare species hot spots</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Quality Control Mechanism</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experts verify photos and identification results</li>
<li>Community mutual aid error correction system</li>
<li>Improve personal identification ability through training and experience</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Quick Tips</strong>: Always take photos of mushrooms from multiple angles – top, bottom, side and growth environment.A coin or ruler as a reference can greatly improve the accuracy of identification.</p>
<br>
<h3>Phenology Research</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>What is phenology</strong>?Phenology studies periodic biological events and their relationship with environmental conditions.In mycology, this mainly refers to the mushroom production time, duration and abundance of mushrooms.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Record points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date of the first observation of a specific species per year</li>
<li>Peak period of mushroom production</li>
<li>Last observed date</li>
<li>Relative abundance (sparse, common, rich)</li>
<li>Related to weather conditions (rainfall, temperature)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>The Value of Citizen Science</strong>:</p>
<p>It is impossible for professional scientists to visit all locations of interest every week.Citizen scientists have accumulated irreplaceable long-term data sets through localized, continuous observations over many years.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Well-known projects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>USA National Phenology Network (scalable to fungal records)</li>
<li>Phenological monitoring program of the British Fungal Society</li>
<li>Seasonal Recording Projects of Regional Fungal Society</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Personal Experience</strong>: I met a retired forester in Michigan. He insisted on recording the mushroom production time of 45 common mushrooms in his woodland for more than 30 years.His dataset has been cited in three scientific papers on the effects of climate change.</p>
<br>
<h3>Rare and endangered species monitoring</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Rarity Species Discovered</strong>:</p>
<p>Amateur mushroom pickers often explore remote areas that are difficult to reach by professional scientists, giving them the opportunity to discover rare species.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Report Process</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Discover unusual or suspected rare mushrooms</p>
<p>2. Take high-quality photos and record detailed locations</p>
<p>3. Report through appropriate platform or contact local fungal experts directly</p>
<p>4. Collect specimens under the guidance of an expert if necessary (only if necessary and legal)</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Fixed-point monitoring</strong>:</p>
<p>Volunteers regularly visit specific locations to track population changes and habitat status of known rare species, providing early warnings for conservation management.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Red Directory Contributions</strong>:</p>
<p>Citizen scientific data directly support the World Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessment of endangered species, providing key distribution ranges and population trend information.</p>
<br>
<h3>Early detection of invasive species</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Identify invasive species</strong>:</p>
<p>Pay attention to mushroom species that look unusual, emerging, or known as invasive.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Report Agreement</strong>:</p>
<p>When suspected invasive species are found, report it to the relevant authorities or experts through appropriate channels immediately.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Monitoring diffusion</strong>:</p>
<p>Track the cutting-edge distribution of known invasion species, collect propagation path and rate data, and support management decision-making.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Successful Cases</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Report of Chestnut Blight in North America</li>
<li>Early discovery of sudden oak death</li>
<li>Tracking of the diffusion of honey bacteria</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Expert recommendation</strong>: Learn about the main invasive fungal species in your area.This knowledge may help you detect new invasions early and gain valuable time for control measures.</p>
<br>
<h3>New species discovery</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Discovery process</strong>:</p>
<p>Amateurs discover mushrooms that look unusual → take high-quality photos and upload them to professional platforms → attract experts' attention → experts conduct morphological and DNA analysis → confirm as a new species</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Honors and Recognition</strong>:</p>
<p>In some cases, new species will be named after the discoverer, or the amateur discoverer becomes co-author of scientific papers.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Real Cases</strong>:</p>
<p>Through the iNaturalist platform alone, dozens of new fungal species have been discovered around the world, including a variety of exophagus in North America and several boletus in Europe.</p>
<br>
<h3>Education and Public Awareness</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Knowledge communication</strong>:</p>
<p>Experienced enthusiasts teach novices through workshops, mushroom picking activities and online platforms to form a virtuous knowledge transfer cycle.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Public awareness enhancement</strong>:</p>
<p>Promote public support for fungi protection by demonstrating the beauty and importance of fungi, and break off superstition and fear about mushrooms.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Community Engagement</strong>:</p>
<p>Volunteers share fungal knowledge in school lectures and community science night activities to enhance their interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education.</p>
<br>
<h3>Specimen collection and preservation</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Specimen Pavilion Contributions</strong>:</p>
<p>Hobbyists can donate high-quality specimens to museums and specimen halls to fill in collection gaps and provide materials for future research.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Collection Ethics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the necessary quantity for collection and identification or scientific research</li>
<li>Leave enough individuals to ensure spore transmission</li>
<li>No known or suspected rare species collected</li>
<li>Comply with all relevant regulations and licensing requirements</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Standard collection method</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collection of complete specimens (including underground parts)</li>
<li>Collect individuals from multiple developmental stages</li>
<li>Select representative specimens (avoid individuals who are too small or too old)</li>
<li>Use paper bags to store different species separately</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Specimen Label</strong>:</p>
<p>It should include field numbers, precise locations, dates, collector names, and references to detailed descriptions and photos.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Save technology</strong>:</p>
<p>Dry the specimens in time (preferably on the day of collection) to ensure they are completely dry (brittle but not tough), use mothballs to prevent insects, and provide appropriate long-term storage conditions.</p>

<h2>How to make a high-quality contribution: a guide to best practices</h2>
<br>
<h3>The art of taking photos</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Basic Photo Group</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top of the cap (displays color, texture and shape)</li>
<li>Bacteria folds or bottom of the pore</li>
<li>Side (showing stalks and rings)</li>
<li>Base (including trench or attachment structure)</li>
<li>Growth environment (displays habitat and companion plants)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Advanced Details</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely close-up photos show the spacing and attachment of bacterial folds</li>
<li>Spore printing photos (if possible)</li>
<li>Slice displays internal structure and color changes</li>
<li>Individuals at different stages of development</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Metadata Integrity</strong>:</p>
<p>Make sure the photos contain or associate accurate dates, times, GPS coordinates, and weather conditions.</p>
<br>
<h3>Data logging standard</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Required Information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location: GPS coordinates plus text description</li>
<li>Date: specific to date</li>
<li>Habitat: forest type, dominant tree species, soil characteristics, terrain</li>
<li>Matrix: wood (tree species and degree of rot), soil, fallen leaves or feces, etc.</li>
<li>Quantity and growth method: solitary, scattered or clustered</li>
<li>Abundance estimation: number of individuals or coverage area</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Value additional information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smell description (just smell)</li>
<li>Taste (just a little, never swallow, and only for known safe species)</li>
<li>Spore printing color</li>
<li>Damage discoloration reaction</li>
<li>The degree of insect worm</li>
<li>Other fungal species around</li>
<li>Personal observation notes</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Authoritity</strong>:</p>
<p>Clearly mark your identification degree."Maybe it is XX type" is far more valuable than the wrong "It is XX type".Be willing to accept corrections and regard them as learning opportunities.</p>
<br>
<h3>Responsible specimen collection</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Collection Ethics</strong>:</p>
<p>Collect only when necessary and follow the principle of "no trace" in the future.For rare or suspected rare species, only photos are taken but not collected.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Professional Collection Technology</strong>:</p>
<p>Use a spatula or knife to dig out the specimen intact to ensure that the underground part is not damaged.Prepare separate paper bags or containers for different species.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Tag importance</strong>:</p>
<p>Field tags should contain unique numbers, corresponding to detailed records.Use waterproof ink to avoid loss of information.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Save method</strong>:</p>
<p>Timely drying is the key to preserving quality.Food dehydrators, fan-assisted drying nets or simple ventilation paper bags are all effective methods.After being completely dried, store in an airtight container that is resistant to insects.</p>
<br>
<h3>Effectively participate in the community</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Online interactive etiquette</strong>:</p>
<p>After uploading and observing, wait patiently for identification and comments.As experience accumulates, help identify other people's observations.Always be respectful and constructive.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Local Society Participation</strong>:</p>
<p>Joining a local fungi society not only speeds up learning, but also provides volunteer opportunities such as event organization or beginner guidance.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Data Sharing Decision</strong>:</p>
<p>Understand the meaning of different data licensing options.For rare or endangered species, consider delaying location disclosure or using fuzzy coordinates to prevent over-acquisition.</p>
<br>
<h2>Skill improvement path</h2>
<br>
