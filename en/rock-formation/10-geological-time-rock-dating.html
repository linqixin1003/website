        <p>Geological time represents the vast expanse of time that has passed since Earth's formation approximately 4.6 billion years ago. Understanding geological time and how to date rocks is crucial for interpreting Earth's history and the processes that have shaped our planet.</p>
        
        <h2>The Concept of Deep Time</h2>
        <p>Deep time refers to the immense duration of Earth's history, far beyond human comprehension. To visualize this, consider that if Earth's history were compressed into a 24-hour day, humans would appear only in the last few seconds.</p>
        
        <h2>Relative Dating Principles</h2>
        <p>Before absolute dating methods were developed, geologists used relative dating to determine the sequence of events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Law of Superposition:</strong> In undisturbed rock layers, the oldest rocks are at the bottom</li>
            <li><strong>Principle of Original Horizontality:</strong> Layers of sediment are originally deposited horizontally</li>
            <li><strong>Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships:</strong> Any feature that cuts across rocks must be younger than the rocks it cuts</li>
            <li><strong>Principle of Faunal Succession:</strong> Fossils appear in a predictable order in the rock record</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Absolute Dating Methods</h2>
        <p>Absolute dating provides numerical ages for rocks and events. The most common method is radiometric dating:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carbon-14 dating:</strong> Used for organic materials up to about 50,000 years old</li>
            <li><strong>Potassium-Argon dating:</strong> Used for rocks older than 100,000 years</li>
            <li><strong>Uranium-Lead dating:</strong> One of the most precise methods for dating ancient rocks</li>
            <li><strong>Samarium-Neodymium dating:</strong> Used for very old rocks and meteorites</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The Geological Time Scale</h2>
        <p>The geological time scale divides Earth's history into eons, eras, periods, and epochs. Major divisions are marked by significant events like mass extinctions or major changes in Earth's climate and life forms.</p>
        
        <h2>Challenges in Rock Dating</h2>
        <p>Dating rocks is not always straightforward. Rocks may have complex histories, including metamorphism or weathering that can reset or disturb their isotopic systems. Geologists must carefully select appropriate samples and methods for each dating problem.</p>
