        <p class="intro">
            Insects face unprecedented challenges from human-driven global change: climate warming, pollution, and
            widespread habitat destruction. These pressures are causing population declines, range shifts, and extinctions
            across North America and worldwide. Understanding these impacts is essential for developing effective
            conservation strategies and mitigating further losses.

        <p>
            Rising temperatures are causing insects to shift their ranges poleward and to higher elevations. Some
            species expand into new areas, while others contract as their preferred climate zones disappear. Warming also
            disrupts phenology—the timing of life cycle events. Many species emerge earlier in spring, but if their host
            plants or prey don't shift similarly, mismatches occur.
        </p>
        <p>
            Extreme heat events can directly kill insects or reduce reproductive success. In the western United States,
            warming and drought have contributed to massive bark beetle outbreaks that have killed millions of trees.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_30310b9a_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Pollution: Pesticides, Light, and Noise</h3>
        <p>
            Pesticides—especially neonicotinoids and other systemic insecticides—have devastating impacts on
            non-target insects, including pollinators and beneficial predators. Light pollution disrupts nocturnal
            navigation for moths and fireflies, while noise pollution interferes with acoustic communication in crickets
            and katydids.
        </p>
        <p>
            Agricultural intensification has reduced insect diversity in many regions, with studies showing dramatic
            declines in biomass and species richness in areas with heavy pesticide use.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_30310b9a_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h3>
        <p>
            Conversion of natural habitats to agriculture, urban development, and other human uses is the primary driver
            of insect declines. Fragmentation—breaking large habitats into smaller, isolated patches—reduces population
            sizes and genetic diversity, making species more vulnerable to extinction. Many insects require specific host
            plants or microhabitats that disappear when landscapes are simplified.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conservation efforts must focus on protecting remaining habitats, restoring degraded areas, and creating
            corridors that connect fragmented populations.

            <div class="tip-title">Field Note</div>
            <p>
                Document changes in your local insect communities over time. Note which species appear earlier or later
                than in previous years, which seem less abundant, and which new species arrive. Share your observations
                with researchers through platforms like iNaturalist or local conservation organizations. Long-term
                community science data is crucial for understanding global change impacts.

        <p class="conclusion">
            The challenges facing insects are immense, but so is our capacity to help. By reducing pesticide use,
            protecting and restoring habitats, participating in monitoring programs, and advocating for conservation
            policies, we can support insect populations and the essential ecosystem services they provide. The future of
            insects—and the ecosystems that depend on them—depends on our actions today.
