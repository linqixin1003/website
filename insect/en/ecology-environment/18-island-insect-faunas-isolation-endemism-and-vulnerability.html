        <p class="intro">
            Islands—whether oceanic islands like Hawaii or habitat islands like mountaintops and isolated wetlands—create
            unique evolutionary laboratories. Isolation leads to high endemism (species found nowhere else) but also
            extreme vulnerability to extinction. Understanding island insect faunas reveals fundamental principles of
            evolution, biogeography, and conservation biology.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_860cab49_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Evolution in Isolation</h3>
        <p>
            When insects colonize islands, they often evolve in isolation from mainland populations. Over time, this can
            lead to new species adapted to island conditions. Hawaii's Drosophila fruit flies, for example, have
            diversified into hundreds of species, many found only on single islands or even single mountains. Flightless
            forms evolve when flight is unnecessary or costly, as seen in some island beetles and crickets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Island insects often lose defensive behaviors or chemical defenses found in mainland relatives, having evolved
            without the same predators or competitors.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_860cab49_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Endemism and Rarity</h3>
        <p>
            Many island insects are endemic, meaning they exist nowhere else on Earth. This endemism makes them
            particularly vulnerable: a single catastrophic event—hurricane, fire, or introduced predator—can drive an
            entire species to extinction. The Laysan weevil, once found only on Laysan Island in Hawaii, went extinct
            after rabbits were introduced and destroyed its host plants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Habitat islands in North America—like isolated wetlands, sand dunes, or alpine meadows—also support endemic
            or highly restricted species that require specific microhabitats.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_860cab49_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Threats and Conservation Challenges</h3>
        <p>
            Island insects face multiple threats: habitat destruction, invasive species, climate change, and
            overcollection. Invasive ants, for example, have devastated native insect communities on many islands by
            outcompeting or preying on endemic species. Climate change threatens high-elevation island species that cannot
            migrate to cooler areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conservation requires protecting entire island ecosystems, controlling invasive species, and sometimes
            establishing captive breeding programs for critically endangered species.

            <p>
                If you visit an island or isolated habitat, document the insects you find but avoid collecting rare or
                endemic species. Take photos instead, and report your observations to local conservation organizations or
                iNaturalist. Your records help track population trends and guide conservation priorities.

        <p class="conclusion">
            Island insect faunas represent unique evolutionary experiments and irreplaceable biodiversity. Their
            vulnerability highlights the urgent need for conservation action to protect these remarkable species and the
            ecosystems they inhabit.
