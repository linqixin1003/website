        <p>Sedimentary rocks form through the accumulation, compaction, and cementation of sediments over millions of years. These rocks preserve Earth's history and contain most of the world's fossils, making them invaluable for understanding past environments and life forms.</p>
        
        <h2>The Formation Process</h2>
        <p>Sedimentary rock formation begins with weathering and erosion of existing rocks. The resulting sediments are transported by wind, water, or ice and deposited in layers. Over time, these layers are buried under additional sediments, leading to compaction and cementation that transforms loose sediments into solid rock.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Sedimentary Rocks</h2>
        <p><strong>Clastic Sedimentary Rocks:</strong> Formed from fragments of other rocks. Examples include sandstone (sand-sized particles), shale (clay and silt), and conglomerate (rounded pebbles and cobbles).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Chemical Sedimentary Rocks:</strong> Formed from minerals precipitated from solution. Examples include limestone (calcium carbonate), rock salt (halite), and gypsum.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Organic Sedimentary Rocks:</strong> Formed from the remains of living organisms. Examples include coal (plant remains) and some limestones (marine organism shells).</p>
        
        <h2>Layering and Stratification</h2>
        <p>The characteristic layered appearance of sedimentary rocks results from changes in sediment type, size, or depositional conditions over time. These layers, called strata, can reveal information about ancient climates, sea levels, and environmental conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>Fossil Preservation</h2>
        <p>Sedimentary rocks are the primary repositories of fossils because the gentle burial process preserves organic remains. The study of fossils in sedimentary layers helps scientists understand evolutionary history and past environmental conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>Economic Importance</h2>
        <p>Many sedimentary rocks have significant economic value. Limestone is used in cement production, sandstone in construction, and shale may contain oil and natural gas. Coal, a sedimentary rock, has been a major energy source for centuries.</p>
