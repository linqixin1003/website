        <h2 class="article-title">How Insects Perceive Their World</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            Insects do not experience the world the way humans do. Their compound eyes are superb at detecting motion,
            their antennae are chemical antennas tuned to faint odor plumes, and sensory hairs along the body detect
            the slightest air currents or vibrations. Understanding these senses explains why a fly dodges a swatter
            so effectively or how a moth can locate a mate from blocks away.

        <p>
            Each compound eye contains dozens to thousands of ommatidia—tiny optical units that together form a mosaic
            image. Many insects see ultraviolet patterns on flowers that are invisible to us, guiding them to nectar
            and pollen. Fast-flying species like dragonflies process visual information at very high frame rates,
            allowing them to track prey in midair.
        </p>
        <p>
            While resolution is lower than human vision, sensitivity to motion is far superior. This is why a housefly
            often launches into flight before a hand gets close: the expanding shadow and air movement trigger an escape
            response almost instantly.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_5980653f_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Smell and Taste: Chemistry in the Air</h3>
        <p>
            Chemoreceptors on antennae, mouthparts, and even feet allow insects to detect trace chemicals. Female
            moths release pheromones that males can sense from hundreds of yards downwind. Mosquitoes home in on carbon
            dioxide, lactic acid, and heat patterns around human skin. Butterflies “taste” with their tarsi, sampling
            leaves before laying eggs to ensure the right host plant.
        </p>
        <p>
            In natural and agricultural systems across the United States, this keen chemical sensitivity determines
            which flowers pollinators visit and which crops attract particular pests.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_5980653f_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Touch, Vibration, and Other Senses</h3>
        <p>
            Fine sensory hairs and stretch receptors distributed over the exoskeleton let insects detect touch,
            gravity, and body position. Many species also perceive substrate-borne vibrations: leafhoppers communicate
            through plant stems, and some caterpillars drum branches to deter rivals. Certain insects detect polarized
            light patterns for navigation or sense Earth’s magnetic field during long-distance migrations.
        </p>
        <p>
            These abilities help insects avoid predators, coordinate with nest-mates, and locate resources even in
            visually cluttered environments.

            <p>
                When watching insects, ask yourself: which sense are they using right now? A butterfly probing flowers
                with its proboscis is tasting; a bee briefly “dancing” at the hive entrance is sharing directional
                information. Writing down these interpretations trains you to think like an entomologist.

        <p class="conclusion">
            Appreciating insect senses changes how you move through the landscape. Quiet movements, reduced artificial
            light at night, and diverse plantings all support the sensory worlds insects rely on. By adjusting our
            behavior, we make it easier for them to feed, reproduce, and continue providing vital ecosystem services.
