Trapezoidal and basal characteristics

Explore the "pillar" of mushrooms

introduction

The stem (also known as the stem or mushroom stem) is a structure connecting the cap to the matrix. It not only assumes the supporting function, but also has important characteristics in identification.In particular, the structure of the base of the stem - such as the rings and trunks - is often the key clue to distinguish between toxic and non-toxic mushrooms.This guide will systematically introduce how to observe and record various characteristics of stalks.

Basic structure of stalk

Trapezoid function
- Support cap to maintain proper height
- Good for spore transmission
- Connect mycelium to fruiting bodies
- Convey nutrients and water

Stomach area
- Top (attached cap)
- Central
- Base (connecting matrix)
- Each region's characteristics may be different

There are sterile stems
- Most mushrooms have fungus stems
- Some wood-breeding species have sterile stems or very short stalks (lateral, partial)
- Position of stem: mesogenesis, partial growth, lateral growth

Stomach shape and size

Height measurement
- From base to cap connection
- Use centimeters as units
- Record range (multiple specimens)
- Pay attention to whether the underground part is included

Coarse measurement
- Measure diameter in the middle of the stem
- Note that the top and base may be different
- Recording is as rough as it is

Common shape types

Equal
- The thickness of the upper and lower parts is basically the same
- The most common types
- Upright, even

Attenuated Upward
- Gradually thinning upward
- The base is thicker
- Conical appearance

Attenuated Downward
- Gradually thinning downward
- The top is thicker
- Inverted cone

Bulbous base (Bulbous)
- The base is enlarged into a spherical shape
- Important features of Amanita
- May be buried by soil and need to be excavated

Club Clavate
- The base gradually becomes thicker
- Like stick shape
- More progressive than bulbous

Spindle shape (Fusiform)
- The thickest in the middle
- Both ends are thinner
- Spindle

Rooting
- The base extends into a root structure
- Deep into the soil or wood
- Need to be fully dug out to observe

Curved or twisted (Curved/Twisted)
- Not upright
- It may be caused by the growth environment
- or species characteristics

Measurement record example
"The stalk is 8-12 cm long, with a top diameter of 1.5 cm, and the base is enlarged to 3 cm, making it bulb-shaped."

Sample Record

"The stalk is 10-15 cm long, isocoarse, 2 cm in diameter, and slightly enlarged at the base. The surface is white, with fine longitudinal patterns, dry, solid. There are white persistent bacteria rings, membranous and slightly striped in the upper middle and upper part of the stalk. There are obvious cystic trunks at the base, white, about 3 cm high, and partly buried in the soil. It does not change color after cutting."

Red flags - The importance of trench and rings

Fatal combination

White Bacteria Fold + Bacteria Ring + Bacteria Stool = Highly alert!

This combination describes Amanita, including:
- Death hat (Amanita phalloides)
- Angel of Destruction (Amanita virosa)
- Other deadly species

Although not all Amanita is toxic and some are edible, this requires expert identification.Beginners should avoid collecting any mushrooms that match this description.

Checklist
□ Always dig out the mushrooms intact
□ Remove soil and debris from the base
□ Carefully check the bacterial tracts and rings
□ Do not collect food if you have any questions
□ Take a close-up photo of the base

Common Errors and Avoidance

Error 1: No base mining
- Consequence: Missing the fungus tract may be fatal
- Avoid: Always dig out from the base with a knife

Error 2: Ignore the residue of bacterial rings
- Consequence: Missing important features
- Avoid: Check the ring marks in the middle and upper part of the stalk

Error 3: Only part of it is described
- Consequence: Incomplete records
- Avoid: Full view from top to base

Error 4: Not measuring
- Consequence: It is difficult to compare with reference books
- Avoid: Use rulers to measure key dimensions

Error 5: Ignore the internal structure
- Consequence: Missing important features such as hollow/solid
- Avoid: Cut at least one specimen

Practical application cases

Case 1: Identification of suspicious Amanita

Observation focus:
- Is there a tray at the base of the stem (must be excavated and checked)
- Is there a bacterial ring
- Cover color (but not reliable)
- Are the bacteria folds free and white

Safety principles:
- If there are bacterial trenches and rings, be wary of
- Never eat when you are uncertain

Case 2: Identification of boletus

Observation focus:
- Is there any reticular mark on the surface of the stalk
- Is it blue or not
- Is the stalk thick?
- Base shape

Case 3: Distinguish between edible and toxic species

Many poisonous mushrooms imitate edible types:
- Carefully check the base (bacterial tract)
- Check the bacterial ring
- Combining multiple features
- If there is any difference, give up

in conclusion

The characteristics of the stem and base play a key role in mushroom identification, especially the two structures of the ring and the trunk. Their presence or absence can often classify mushrooms into specific families or genus.More importantly, these characteristics are crucial for safe identification – many of the deadliest mushrooms are marked by fungal troughs and rings.

Key points:
- Always dig out the mushrooms intact, check the base
- Bacteria truncated and rings are life-critical characteristics
- Measure and record accurate dimensions
- Observe all changes from top to base
- Incide at least one specimen to observe the interior
Remember: Invisible bacterial stents does not mean there is no bacterial stent!It may be buried in the soil.This simple check can save your life.

Combined with the observation of bacterial caps, pleats and stalks, you have now mastered the three pillars of mushroom morphology identification.Keep learning spore printing, ecological characteristics and other tips and you will be able to identify more and more mushroom species safely and accurately.

I wish you careful observation and safe identification!

### Mushroom consumption risk warning

1. **Life safety first**: There are inherent risks in the identification of wild mushrooms.Many toxic mushrooms look very similar to edible mushrooms, and accidentally ingesting them can lead to serious illness or even death.

2. **Professional identification required**: Before eating any wild mushrooms, 100% confirmation must be performed by a professional mycologist or certified mushroom identification expert.Photos, text descriptions and personal experience are not sufficient to ensure safety.

3. **Individual Differences**: Even recognized edible mushrooms may cause adverse reactions due to factors such as personal constitution, allergic reactions, consumption method or mushroom growth environment.Try in small quantities when eating a new variety for the first time.

4. **Geographical differences**: There are huge differences in mushroom species and toxicity in different regions.The information mentioned in this article may not apply to your region.Please consult local mycology experts and authoritative organizations.

5. **Professional Responsibility**: The author and the publisher shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damage, disease or loss arising from the use of the information in this article.

### Safety advice

- ✅ Participate in formal mushroom identification training courses
- ✅ Join the local mycology association or mushroom club
- ✅ Purchase cultivated mushrooms from reliable sources
- ✅ Save mushroom samples for emergency medical needs
- ✅ Do not eat it if you have any doubts

**Remember: When you have any questions, the only safe option is not to eat it.Your life safety is far more important than any mushroom meal.**
