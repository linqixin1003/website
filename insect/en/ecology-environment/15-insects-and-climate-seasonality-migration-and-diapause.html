        <h2 class="article-title">Insects and Climate: Seasonality, Migration, and Diapause</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            Insects synchronize their life cycles with seasonal changes in temperature, day length, and food availability.
            Some species migrate thousands of miles to track favorable conditions, while others enter diapause—a
            programmed dormancy—to survive harsh winters or dry seasons. Understanding these strategies helps predict how
            insects will respond to climate change across North America.

        <p>
            Many insects emerge at precise times each year, triggered by accumulated degree-days or photoperiod cues.
            Eastern tent caterpillars hatch in early spring when host trees leaf out, while periodical cicadas emerge in
            13- or 17-year cycles synchronized across vast regions. Climate warming is shifting these timing patterns:
            some species emerge earlier, creating mismatches with their food plants or predators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tracking first emergence dates—when you first see a particular butterfly, dragonfly, or beetle each year—helps
            scientists document phenological shifts and understand ecosystem-level consequences.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_3f395c28_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Migration: Long-Distance Travelers</h3>
        <p>
            Monarch butterflies undertake one of the most spectacular insect migrations, traveling from breeding grounds
            across the United States and Canada to overwintering sites in Mexico and coastal California. Dragonflies like
            the green darner also migrate, riding favorable winds southward in fall. These migrations require precise
            navigation using sun compasses, magnetic fields, and landscape features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Climate change threatens migrations by altering wind patterns, reducing overwintering habitat, and disrupting
            the timing of nectar availability along migration routes.

        <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-icon"><img src="../../images/insect_3f395c28_icon.jpg" alt="" class="section-icon-img" loading="lazy"></span> Diapause: Surviving the Off-Season</h3>
        <p>
            Diapause is a state of suspended development that allows insects to survive unfavorable conditions. Many
            temperate species enter diapause as eggs, larvae, or pupae, resuming development when temperatures warm or
            day length increases. Some desert insects enter diapause during dry periods, emerging only after rainfall
            triggers plant growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Warmer winters can disrupt diapause timing, causing insects to break dormancy too early and face late freezes
            or lack of food resources.

            <p>
                Keep a phenology journal: record the first date you observe key species each season (e.g., first monarch,
                first firefly, first katydid song). Over years, these records reveal how climate shifts affect insect
                timing in your region. Share your data with programs like Nature's Notebook or Journey North.

        <p class="conclusion">
            Insects' responses to climate—through migration, diapause, and phenological shifts—reveal both their
            remarkable adaptability and their vulnerability to rapid environmental change. Your observations contribute to
            understanding these dynamics and informing conservation strategies.
