            <h1>Rocks and Environmental Processes</h1>
            
            <p>Rocks and the environment have a dynamic, interconnected relationship. Environmental processes shape rocks through weathering and erosion, while rocks influence the environment by affecting climate, soil formation, and ecosystem development. This article explores these complex interactions and their significance in shaping our planet's landscapes and supporting life.</p>

            <h2>Weathering: The Breakdown of Rocks</h2>
            
            <p>Weathering is the process by which rocks are broken down into smaller particles or altered in composition by exposure to the atmosphere, water, and biological organisms. There are three main types of weathering:</p>
            
            <div class="weathering-types">
                <div class="weathering-card">
                    <h3>Physical Weathering</h3>
                    <p>Physical weathering, also known as mechanical weathering, involves the breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces without changing their chemical composition.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Frost wedging:</strong> Water freezes in rock cracks, expanding and breaking the rock</li>
                        <li><strong>Thermal expansion:</strong> Temperature changes cause rocks to expand and contract, leading to cracking</li>
                        <li><strong>Exfoliation:</strong> Pressure release causes outer layers of rocks to peel off</li>
                        <li><strong>Abrasion:</strong> Rocks are worn down by friction from wind, water, or other rocks</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="weathering-card">
                    <h3>Chemical Weathering</h3>
                    <p>Chemical weathering involves the alteration of a rock's chemical composition through reactions with water, oxygen, and other substances in the environment.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hydrolysis:</strong> Water reacts with minerals to form new compounds</li>
                        <li><strong>Oxidation:</strong> Oxygen reacts with minerals (often iron) to form oxides</li>
                        <li><strong>Carbonation:</strong> Carbon dioxide in water forms carbonic acid, which dissolves carbonate rocks</li>
                        <li><strong>Acid precipitation:</strong> Acid rain accelerates chemical weathering</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="weathering-card">
                    <h3>Biological Weathering</h3>
                    <p>Biological weathering is caused by the activities of living organisms, including plants, animals, and microorganisms.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Root wedging:</strong> Plant roots grow into rock cracks, exerting pressure and breaking rocks</li>
                        <li><strong>Burrowing animals:</strong> Animals dig and move rock particles, exposing fresh surfaces to weathering</li>
                        <li><strong>Microbial activity:</strong> Bacteria and fungi produce acids that dissolve minerals</li>
                        <li><strong>Decay processes:</strong> Organic matter decomposition produces acids that weather rocks</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Erosion and Transportation</h2>
            
            <p>Erosion is the process by which weathered rock particles are transported away from their original location by natural agents. The main agents of erosion include:</p>
            
            <div class="erosion-agents">
                <div class="erosion-card">
                    <h3>Water Erosion</h3>
                    <p>Water is the most powerful agent of erosion, capable of moving particles ranging in size from clay to boulders.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rainfall:</strong> Direct impact of raindrops dislodges particles</li>
                        <li><strong>Streams and rivers:</strong> Moving water carries sediment downstream</li>
                        <li><strong>Waves:</strong> Coastal erosion by wave action</li>
                        <li><strong>Glaciers:</strong> Moving ice transports large amounts of rock material</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="erosion-card">
                    <h3>Wind Erosion</h3>
                    <p>Wind erosion is most effective in dry, sparsely vegetated areas where loose particles are easily lifted and transported.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Saltation:</strong> Medium-sized particles bounce along the ground</li>
                        <li><strong>Suspension:</strong> Fine particles are carried through the air</li>
                        <li><strong>Surface creep:</strong> Large particles are rolled along the ground</li>
                        <li><strong>Aeolian processes:</strong> Formation of sand dunes and dust storms</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="erosion-card">
                    <h3>Gravity-Driven Erosion</h3>
                    <p>Gravity causes rock and soil to move downslope, often triggered by water, earthquakes, or human activities.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mass wasting:</strong> General term for downslope movement of rock and soil</li>
                        <li><strong>Landslides:</strong> Rapid movement of rock and debris</li>
                        <li><strong>Mudflows:</strong> Flowing mixtures of water, soil, and rock fragments</li>
                        <li><strong>Creep:</strong> Slow, continuous movement of soil and rock</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Rocks and Climate</h2>
            
            <p>Rocks and climate have a reciprocal relationship: climate influences weathering and erosion rates, while rocks can affect local and regional climate patterns.</p>
            
            <h3>How Climate Affects Rocks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Higher temperatures accelerate chemical weathering</li>
                <li><strong>Precipitation:</strong> Increased rainfall intensifies both physical and chemical weathering</li>
                <li><strong>Freeze-thaw cycles:</strong> Common in temperate climates, causing significant physical weathering</li>
                <li><strong>Wind patterns:</strong> Strong winds increase abrasion and wind erosion in arid climates</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How Rocks Affect Climate</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Albedo:</strong> Light-colored rocks reflect more sunlight, cooling the surrounding area</li>
                <li><strong>Thermal mass:</strong> Rocks store heat during the day and release it at night, moderating temperature</li>
                <li><strong>Topography:</strong> Rock formations influence local weather patterns through orographic lifting</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon cycle:</strong> Chemical weathering of rocks removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rocks and Soil Formation</h2>
            
            <p>Soil formation, or pedogenesis, is closely linked to rock weathering. Rocks are the primary source of mineral nutrients in soil, and different rock types produce different soil characteristics.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parent material:</strong> The type of rock from which soil forms determines its mineral composition</li>
                <li><strong>Weathering rate:</strong> Controls the rate at which nutrients are released into the soil</li>
                <li><strong>Soil texture:</strong> Determined by the size of weathered rock particles (sand, silt, clay)</li>
                <li><strong>Soil fertility:</strong> Influenced by the mineral content of the parent rock</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rocks and Ecosystems</h2>
            
            <p>Rocks play a fundamental role in shaping ecosystems and supporting life:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitat creation:</strong> Rock formations provide shelter and nesting sites for many organisms</li>
                <li><strong>Water storage:</strong> Fractured rocks can store groundwater, providing water sources for plants and animals</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrient cycling:</strong> Weathered rocks release essential minerals that support plant growth</li>
                <li><strong>Microhabitats:</strong> Different rock types create diverse microenvironments with varying moisture, temperature, and nutrient conditions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Human Impacts on Rocks and Environmental Processes</h2>
            
            <p>Human activities have significantly altered the relationship between rocks and environmental processes:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mining:</strong> Extracting minerals from rocks disrupts natural formations and increases erosion</li>
                <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> Construction and development alter natural drainage patterns and increase runoff</li>
                <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Removing vegetation increases erosion and sedimentation</li>
                <li><strong>Climate change:</strong> Altered temperature and precipitation patterns affect weathering rates</li>
                <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Chemical pollutants can accelerate weathering or contaminate rock and soil</li>
            </ul>
