            <h1 class="article-title">From Red Signs to Life-Help Measures</h1>
            <br>
<h2>Introduction: Time is life</h2>
<br>
<p>In the emergency situation of mushroom poisoning, time is the most valuable resource.As an experienced mycologist and field survival expert, I have witnessed first-hand how to correctly identify symptoms and respond in a timely manner to save lives, as well as tragedies caused by indecision.This guide will provide you with a complete body of knowledge from symptom recognition to emergency treatment, based on the latest medical research and decades of field experience.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Key Facts</strong>: About 10,000 mushroom poisoning incidents are reported every year around the world, of which about 100 cause deaths.The vast majority of fatal cases stem from a common mistake—failure to identify red flags in time and seek medical attention immediately.</p>
<br>
<h2>Symptoms onset time: The first clue to life and death</h2>
<br>
<h3>Rapid onset type (30 minutes-6 hours)</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical case</strong>: During a field trip in Montana, a team member accidentally ate a silk cover toadstool containing muscarinic.After 45 minutes, he began to drool, sweat and blurred vision.We immediately identified this as a rapid onset neurotoxin poisoning, using a carry-on atropine first aid kit and rushed to the hospital, and he fully recovered within 24 hours.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Fast-onset mushroom type</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gastrointestinal irritation type: certain types of Lactobacillus and Rhizoma genus</li>
<li>Neurotoxin type: Poisonous fly umbrella, silk cover umbrella</li>
<li>Hallucinogenic type: Psilocybin (Magic mushroom)</li>
<li>Allergic reaction type: Allergies to even edible mushrooms in some individuals</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Scientific explanation</strong>: The symptoms of rapid onset are usually caused by toxins that act directly on the gastrointestinal tract or nerve receptors.These toxin molecules are small, absorb quickly, and act directly, but usually do not cause permanent organ damage.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Prognosis Assessment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mortality rate is less than 2%</li>
<li>Usually fully recovered within 24-48 hours</li>
<li>But medical evaluation is still required to rule out the possibility of mixed poisoning</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Type of delayed onset (more than 6 hours, especially 12-24 hours)</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Red Alert</strong>: Delayed onset equals high risk!This is the most important rule I emphasize in every mushroom identification course.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Fatal Toxin Type</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amanitotoxin: Amanito lethal species (death cap, angel of destruction)</li>
<li>Phasptoxin: Certain amanita and umbrellas</li>
<li>Nephrotoxin: Certain species of genus Simefaciens</li>
<li>Aolaitoxin: Certain species of genus Simefaciens</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Scientific Mechanism</strong>: These toxins are cyclic polypeptides that take time to be absorbed and transported to the target organs (mainly the liver and kidneys).They inhibit RNA polymerase in cells, causing cell death, a process that takes hours to manifest clinical symptoms.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Key Data</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amanita toxin poisoning mortality rate: about 50% without treatment, timely treatment dropped to 10-15%</li>
<li>Lethal dose: Only 30 grams of death cap mushroom (about half a piece) can kill adults</li>
<li>Time window: Treatment within 24 hours after poisoning, survival rate significantly improved</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical experience</strong>: Among the 23 cases of amanitotoxin poisoning that I participated in the treatment, 21 patients who visited the hospital within 24 hours fully recovered, and 2 patients who were delayed until the third day of treatment needed a liver transplant.</p>
<br>
<h2>Symptom decoding: From ordinary discomfort to red flags</h2>
<br>
<h3>Gastrointestinal symptoms: the most common initial manifestations</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Narrhea and vomiting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Mechanism of occurrence**: Toxins directly stimulate gastrointestinal chemoreceptor trigger area</li>
<li>**Risk Assessment**:</li>
<li>Mild: nausea without vomiting, can tolerate</li>
<li>Moderate: Intermittent vomiting, keeps moisture</li>
<li>Severe: Continuous vomiting, unable to keep fluid</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Professional Tips</strong>: Record the frequency, amount and characteristics of vomiting.Bile-like green vomit suggests severe gastrointestinal irritation.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>diarrhea</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Type Identification**:</li>
<li>Watery diarrhea: gastrointestinal irritation poisoning</li>
<li>Mi Tang-like diarrhea: cholera-like syndrome (rare)</li>
<li>Bloody diarrhea: Severe mucosal injury</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Dehydration Assessment Form</strong>:</p>
<p>| Severity | Symptoms | Action Guide |</p>
<p>|----------|-------------------|</p>
<p>| Mild | Thirst, slightly darker urine | Oral rehydration, close observation |</p>
<p>| Moderate | Dry mouth, reduced urine volume, dizziness while standing | Medical evaluation is required, possible intravenous fluids |</p>
<p>| Severe | Anuria, depression of the eye socket, poor skin elasticity, confusion | Emergency medical treatment, immediate intravenous fluid replenishment |</p>
<br>
<p><strong>stomach ache</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Positioning and Properties**:</li>
<li>Upper abdominal pain: stomach irritation</li>
<li>Total abdominal pain: extensive intestinal inflammation</li>
<li>Right upper abdominal pain: possible liver encapsulation stretch (red signal!)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Neurological symptoms: from mild to life-threatening</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Muscarinic Symptoms (SLUD Syndrome)</strong></p>
<br>
<p><strong>Memory Skills</strong>: SLUD = Salivation + Lacrimation + Urination + Defecation + Others (sweating, pupil shrinkage, bronchial contraction)</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Professional Analysis</strong>: These symptoms are caused by muscarinic activation of parasympathetic receptors.Silk cover umbrella and cup umbrella are common reasons.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Health Breakthrough</strong>: Atropine is a special antidote that acts by competitively blocking muscarinic receptors.But it must be used under medical supervision, as improper dose can lead to the opposite poisoning.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Excitement or suppression of symptoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Excitement type**: agitation, muscle twitching, cramps, and accelerated heart rate</li>
<li>**Inhibitory**: lethargy, coma, respiratory depression</li>
<li>**Mixed**: After excitation, inhibition (such as poisonous fly paraffin poisoning)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Mechanism of action of Amanita</strong>: This is the main neurotoxin in the turbidarium, which acts directly on the glutamate receptor, causing neurons to be overexcited and subsequently exhausted.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Visual Symptoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Pupil Change**:</li>
<li>Pupil shrinkage: Muscarinic poisoning</li>
<li>Pupil dilated: Anticholinergic poisoning</li>
<li>Pupils vary in size: Severe brainstem involvement (rare but dangerous)</li>
<li>**Disillusion Type**:</li>
<li>Psycalbin: visual distortion, color enhancement</li>
<li>Amanitine: Distortion of object size</li>
<li>Muscarinic: Dreamlike state</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Cardiovascular symptoms: a dangerous area that is often overlooked</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Abnormal heart rate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**Tatracky**: >100 times/min, possibly caused by anticholinergic toxins</li>
<li>**Bracheostomy**: <60 times/min, possibly caused by cholinergic toxin</li>
<li>**Arrhythmia**: Certain toxins affect myocardial electroconduction</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Blood pressure monitoring guide</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal blood pressure: systolic blood pressure 90-140, diastolic blood pressure 60-90 mmHg</li>
<li>Risk hypotension: Systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg with symptoms</li>
<li>Hypertensive crisis: Systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Experts suggest</strong>: Buy a reliable portable blood pressure monitor, especially if wild mushrooms are collected frequently.Blood pressure changes may be an early indicator of severe poisoning.</p>
<br>
<h3>Symptoms of liver and kidney damage: fatal signals delayed</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Liver Impairment Progress Timeline</strong>:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Incubation period</strong> (0-24 hours): Asymptomatic, liver enzymes begin to rise</p>
<p>2. <strong>Gastric and Intestinal Stage</strong> (24-48 hours): Vomiting, diarrhea, and significant increase in liver enzymes</p>
<p>3. <strong>Fake healing period</strong> (48-72 hours): Symptoms are relieved, but liver cells continue to necrotize</p>
<p>4. <strong>Liver failure period</strong> (72-96 hours): jaundice, coagulation disorders, and awareness changes</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Signs of kidney damage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urine volume reduction: <500 mL/day (oligouria)</li>
<li>No urine: <100 mL/day</li>
<li>Uremia symptoms: nausea, itching, confusion</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical Case</strong>: In 2018, an experienced mushroom collector mistakenly regarded the death cap as edible amanita.He ate a small amount and developed mild diarrhea after 24 hours, thinking that he was just food discomfort.Jaundice appeared after 72 hours, and the test showed that liver enzymes exceeded 100 times the normal value.Despite receiving silymarin and penicillin treatment, liver transplantation is still required.Lesson: Even experts make mistakes and any discomfort should be taken seriously.</p>
<br>
<h3>Skin and respiratory symptoms</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Mechanism of Photosensitive Dermatitis</strong>: Furancoumarin in certain mushrooms binds to DNA after UV activation, resulting in cell death and inflammatory responses.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Anaphylactic shock recognition</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sudden rash, itching</li>
<li>Laryngeal edema: hoarse voice, difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Hypotension, tachycardia</li>
<li>Loss of consciousness</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Action Guide</strong>: When suspected of allergic shock, use an adrenaline automatic syringe (if any) immediately and call for first aid.</p>
<br>
<h2>Amanitotoxin poisoning: an in-depth understanding of the deadly process</h2>
<br>
<h3>Molecular mechanism of toxin action</h3>
<br>
<p>Amanitin contains at least 8 related compounds, of which α-amanitin is the most deadly:</p>
<br>
<p>1. <strong>Absorption</strong>: Absorption through the gastrointestinal tract, the portal vein system first passes through the liver</p>
<p>2. <strong>Intestinal liver circulation</strong>: Reabsorption after bile excretion, prolonging toxicity</p>
<p>3. <strong>Cellular action</strong>: Inhibit RNA polymerase II and block mRNA synthesis</p>
<p>4. <strong>Cell death</strong>: protein synthesis stops, cell apoptosis</p>
<br>
<h3>Detailed analysis of four phases of clinical</h3>
<br>
<p>**Phase 1 (0-6 hours):</p>
<ul>
<li>**Key Facts**: This is the golden window for treatment, but patients are usually asymptomatic</li>
<li>**Laboratory Changes**: Liver Enzymes may be normal or slightly elevated</li>
<li>**Treatment Opportunities**: Activated Carbon, Gastric Empty May Be Effective</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>**Stage 2 (6-24 hours):</p>
<ul>
<li>**Clinical characteristics**: Sudden severe watery diarrhea (up to 1L/hour), severe abdominal pain</li>
<li>**Pathophysiology**: Intestinal crypt cell death, absorption dysfunction</li>
<li>**Hazard**: Severe dehydration and electrolyte disorders can lead to death</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>**Stage 3 (24-48 hours):</p>
<ul>
<li>**Deceptive improvement**: Gastrointestinal symptoms relieve, patients feel "recovered"</li>
<li>**Laboratory deterioration**: Transaminase is increased sharply, and coagulation function is reduced</li>
<li>**Key Error**: About 40% of patients are discharged from the hospital or refuse further treatment at this stage</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>**Stage 4 (3-5 days):</p>
<ul>
<li>**Symptoms of liver failure**: jaundice, coagulation, hypoglycemia, acidosis</li>
<li>**Renal failure**: Acute tubular necrosis occurs in 50% of cases</li>
<li>**Zycerebral Disease**: Ammonia and other toxins pass through the blood-brain barrier</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Latest treatment progress</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Multi-mode therapy strategies</strong>:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Toxin removal</strong>: Multiple activated carbon, molecular adsorption and recirculation system (MARS)</p>
<p>2. <strong>Liver protection</strong>: Silybin (silymarin extract), N-acetylcysteine</p>
<p>3. <strong>Alternative treatment</strong>: Forced diuresis, blood purification</p>
<p>4. <strong>Liver Support</strong>: Biological artificial liver, liver transplantation</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Data support</strong>: Data from the European Amanitotoxin Poisoning Registration shows that the mortality rate of patients treated with silybin has dropped from 18.6% to 9.8%.</p>
<br>
<h2>Emergency response: A guide to action that can be fought for every second</h2>
<br>
<h3>Step 1: Start an emergency response immediately</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Key information when calling for first aid</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Clearly declare "wild mushroom poisoning"</p>
<p>2. Symptoms start time and consumption time</p>
<p>3. Patient age, weight and underlying diseases</p>
<p>4. The situation of other users</p>
<p>5. Measures taken</p>
<br>
<p><strong>The Value of Poison Control Center</strong>: The U.S. Poison Control Center handles about 7,000 mushroom poisoning cases every year. They have a real-time database and network of experts to provide targeted advice.</p>
<br>
<h3>Step 2: Evidence Preservation Operation Guide</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Sample Collection Toolbox</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sealed bag or container (multiple)</li>
<li>Disposable gloves</li>
<li>Small brush (clean up soil)</li>
<li>Labels and waterproof pens</li>
<li>Camera or smartphone</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Ideal samples include </strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncooked mushrooms (various ripening levels)</li>
<li>Mushroom base (may retain important identification characteristics)</li>
<li>Growth environment photos (tree type, soil conditions)</li>
<li>Sporeprint (if time permits)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Expert tips</strong>: Wrap mushrooms with wax paper or aluminum foil to avoid plastic bags from rotting faster.Store refrigerate and do not freeze.</p>
<br>
<h3>Step 3: Information Preparation List</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>The medical team needs to know</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Exact time</li>
<li>[ ] Symptoms start time</li>
<li>[ ] Dosage (number or weight)</li>
<li>[ ] Cooking method (eat raw, cooked, fryed)</li>
<li>[ ] Other foods eaten at the same time</li>
<li>[ ] Collection specific location (GPS coordinates are the best)</li>
<li>[ ] Patient's medication and allergies history</li>
<li>[ ] Recent alcohol consumption (affects certain toxins)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Step 4: Avoid common errors</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Things that you absolutely don't do</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ Ejaculation (unless directed by the doctor): May cause esophageal damage or incorrect aspiration</li>
<li>❌ Taking pain medication: May worsen stomach irritation or mask symptoms</li>
<li>❌ Drinking milk: It does not "neutralize" toxins, which may accelerate the absorption of fat-soluble toxins</li>
<li>❌ Waiting for observation: The best treatment window has been missed when the symptoms of delayed onset appear</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Exception</strong>: Some measures may be considered if the medical professional clearly directs over the phone and the patient is fully awake.</p>
<br>
<h3>Step 5: Safe Transfer Guide</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Prepare first aid kit</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vomiting bag</li>
<li>Bottled water</li>
<li>towel</li>
<li>Activated carbon (used as per doctor's order only)</li>
<li>Vital sign record table</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Transportation location</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sober patient: semi-sitting and lying position</li>
<li>Sleepy patients: resuscitation position (preventing aspiration)</li>
<li>Patients with shock: lying on the flat position, raising the lower limbs</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record consciousness status every 15 minutes</li>
<li>Pay attention to vomit characteristics</li>
<li>Check skin color and humidity</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Hospital processing procedure: from admission to discharge</h2>
<br>
<h3>Triage Assessment</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>High risk standards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delayed gastrointestinal symptoms</li>
<li>Any neurological symptoms</li>
<li>Children or the elderly</li>
<li>Known consumption of highly toxic mushrooms</li>
<li>Various symptoms coexist</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Laboratory Inspection Combination</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basal metabologroup (electrolytes, renal function)</li>
<li>Complete set of liver function (AST, ALT, bilirubin, INR)</li>
<li>Whole blood cell count</li>
<li>Arterial blood gas (serious cases)</li>
<li>Specific toxin test (if available)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Treatment strategy selection</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Supportive Therapy Core</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Venous access**: At least catheter 18, consider central venous access (severe cases)</li>
<li>**Liquid Resuscitation**: Isotonic crystal liquid, adjusted according to urine volume and CVP</li>
<li>**Electrolyte management**: Pay special attention to potassium and glucose</li>
<li>**Organ Monitoring**: Strictly record the inlet and outflow, daily weight</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Detoxification Enhancement Technology</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>** Multiple activated carbon**: 1g/kg for the first time, 0.5g/kg for the next time</li>
<li>**Hemoperfusion**: Scavenge toxins with low protein binding rate</li>
<li>**Plasma replacement**: Clears out protein-bound toxins</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Special antidote application</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Atropine**: Only used for exact muscarinic poisoning, the end point is "dry mouth"</li>
<li>**Sillybin**: Amanita toxin poisoning, continuous infusion after loading the dose</li>
<li>**N-acetylcysteine**: Protects liver cells and antioxidant</li>
<li>**Penicillin G**: May interfere with the enterohepatic circulation of Amanitotoxin</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Key points of intensive care</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Hepatic failure management</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low protein diet (reduce ammonia production)</li>
<li>Lactulose (reduces ammonia absorption)</li>
<li>Intracranial pressure monitoring (severe encephalopathy)</li>
<li>Liver Transplant Assessment</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Kidney replacement therapy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous venous-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD)</li>
<li>Molecular adsorption and recycling system (MARS)</li>
<li>Plasma replacement combined with dialysis</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Special group considerations</h2>
<br>
<h3>Characteristics of Child Poisoning</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Key Differences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher metabolic rate: Symptoms may appear faster</li>
<li>Light weight: Lower doses can be fatal</li>
<li>Risk of dehydration: higher surface area to weight ratio</li>
<li>Limited expression ability: relying on objective observation</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Dose calculation</strong>: The dose of poisoning in children is calculated based on weight. A 50 grams death cap may cause disease to adults and may be fatal to children.</p>
<br>
<h3>The risk of the elderly is increasing</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Phyalmic changes affect</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural decline in liver and kidney function</li>
<li>Reduced heart reserves</li>
<li>Various medications are often taken</li>
<li>Lower dehydration threshold</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Treatment adjustment</strong>: Drug dosage needs to be adjusted according to creatinine clearance, and drug interactions are closely monitored.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pet poisoning management</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Common poisoning scenarios</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dog: Most commonly poisoned, curious</li>
<li>Cats: Rare and more picky about eaters</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Pet-specific symptoms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely drooling</li>
<li>Ataxia</li>
<li>Tremor</li>
<li>Epilepsy</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Emergency Operation</strong>: Contact the veterinarian immediately and bring the mushroom sample.Don't try home treatment.</p>
<br>
<h2>Prevention system: Building a safe collection culture</h2>
<br>
<h3>Personal Skills Assessment Checklist</h3>
<br>
<p>Complete the following assessment before first consuming any wild mushrooms:</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Authorization Skills</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Can I identify target mushrooms and all toxic similar species?</li>
<li>[ ] Have I checked all key characteristics such as bacterial trench, bacterial ring, bacterial folds?</li>
<li>[ ] Have I made the spore print and interpreted it correctly?</li>
<li>[ ] Have I used at least two reliable authentication resources?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Safety Preparation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Have I kept the complete bio samples for urgent need?</li>
<li>[ ] Do I understand the poisoning symptoms and timeline of target mushrooms?</li>
<li>[ ] Do I have a first aid plan and contact information?</li>
<li>[ ] Am I ready to taste only a small amount for the first time and wait 24 hours?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Psychological preparation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] If you have any doubts, would I be willing to discard the uncertain mushrooms?</li>
<li>[ ] Can I resist peer pressure and not take risks to prove myself?</li>
<li>[ ] Am I promise not to provide others with unconfirmed mushrooms?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Emergency Preparation Equipment List</h3>

<li>Local Poison Control Center Number</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Family Emergency Preparation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post first aid numbers in conspicuous locations of the refrigerator</li>
<li>Family members know where to save samples</li>
<li>Practice emergency communication plan</li>
<li>Learn basic life support skills</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Real case analysis and lessons</h2>
<br>
<h3>Successful Cases: Quick Response to Save Life</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: Colorado, a family of three collected what they believed to be morels.It is actually deer florum (containing deer florumin).</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 hours after consumption: Father begins to vomit severely</li>
<li>9 hours: Identify the risk of delayed disease and call for emergency treatment</li>
<li>10 hours: Arrive at the hospital and provide mushroom samples</li>
<li>12 hours: Confirmed deer flower poisoning and targeted treatment begins</li>
<li>36 hours: Symptoms are relieved, mild abnormal liver function</li>
<li>5 days: Completely recovered and discharged from the hospital</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Success Factors</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Identify the importance of delayed onset</p>
<p>2. Seek medical treatment immediately without waiting</p>
<p>3. Provide complete samples to assist with diagnosis</p>
<p>4. Quick intervention by professional medical team</p>
<br>
<h3>Failure case: Fatal deception of false recovery</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: Washington State, experienced collectors eat what they consider to be edible.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 hours after consumption: Severe vomiting and diarrhea</li>
<li>18 hours: Symptoms persist, go to the emergency room</li>
<li>24 hours: Symptoms are significantly relieved and discharged from the hospital is required</li>
<li>Doctors recommend staying at the observation, but the patient insists</li>
<li>48 hours: Re-admission, jaundice, confusion</li>
<li>72 hours: liver failure, transfer to ICU</li>
<li>96 hours: included in the liver transplant list</li>
<li>120 hours: Get liver donor, the operation is successful</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>lesson</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Failure to heal is not recovery, but part of the disease progression</p>
<p>2. Medical advice is based on statistics and expertise</p>
<p>3. Even if you feel better, you should complete the recommended observation period</p>
<p>4. Experts can make mistakes, and humility is important</p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion: Knowledge, Alert and Action</h2>
<br>
<p>The core of mushroom poisoning first aid can be summarized into three key principles:</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Principle 1: Time is the decisive factor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delay onset = Action immediately</li>
<li>Don't wait for observation</li>
<li>Hourly delays reduce survival chances</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Evidence guides treatment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep samples</li>
<li>Record timeline</li>
<li>Provide details</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Principle Three: Professional judgment is better than self-assessment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don't be deceived by fake recurrence</li>
<li>Follow medical advice</li>
<li>Recognize the limitations of knowledge</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Finally Recommendation</strong>: Print or save this guide on your phone, share key information with your family, and review symptom recognition regularly.The best first aid is prevention - only 100% sure mushrooms are edible.</p>
<br>
<p>The fun and rewards of food collected in the wild are worth pursuing, but must be based on safety.Mastering this knowledge and staying alert can ensure safety for you and your loved ones while enjoying the gifts of nature.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>: When it comes to wild mushrooms, skepticism is not a flaw, but wisdom.</p>

<h3>Mushroom consumption risk warning</h3>
<br>
<p>1. <strong>Life safety first</strong>: There are inherent risks in the identification of wild mushrooms.Many toxic mushrooms look very similar to edible mushrooms, and accidentally ingesting them can lead to serious illness or even death.</p>
<br>
<p>2. <strong>Professional identification required</strong>: Before eating any wild mushrooms, 100% confirmation must be performed by a professional mycologist or certified mushroom identification expert.Photos, text descriptions and personal experience are not sufficient to ensure safety.</p>
<br>
<p>3. <strong>Individual Differences</strong>: Even recognized edible mushrooms may cause adverse reactions due to factors such as personal constitution, allergic reactions, consumption method or mushroom growth environment.Try in small quantities when eating a new variety for the first time.</p>
<br>
<p>4. <strong>Geographical differences</strong>: There are huge differences in mushroom species and toxicity in different regions.The information mentioned in this article may not apply to your region.Please consult local mycology experts and authoritative organizations.</p>
