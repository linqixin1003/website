        <p>The rock cycle is Earth's grand recycling process, where rocks are continuously transformed from one type to another through geological processes. This dynamic system connects the Earth's interior with its surface, involving igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Components of the Rock Cycle</h2>
        <p>The rock cycle consists of several interconnected processes that work together to create and transform rocks:</p>
        
        <h2>Formation of Igneous Rocks</h2>
        <p>Igneous rocks form when magma cools and solidifies either beneath the Earth's surface (intrusive) or on the surface (extrusive). This process, known as crystallization, is the starting point for many rock cycle pathways.</p>
        
        <h2>Sedimentary Rock Formation</h2>
        <p>Sedimentary rocks form through the accumulation and lithification of sediment. Weathering and erosion break down existing rocks into smaller particles, which are then transported by water, wind, or ice. Over time, these sediments become compacted and cemented together.</p>
        
        <h2>Metamorphic Transformation</h2>
        <p>Metamorphic rocks form when existing rocks are subjected to heat, pressure, or chemical processes without melting. This transformation occurs deep within the Earth's crust and can change both the mineral composition and texture of the original rock.</p>
        
        <h2>Uplift and Erosion</h2>
        <p>Tectonic forces uplift rocks to the Earth's surface, where they are exposed to weathering and erosion. This process begins the cycle anew by creating sediment that will eventually form new sedimentary rocks.</p>
        
        <h2>The Rock Cycle and Time</h2>
        <p>The rock cycle operates over vast geological timescales, with some processes taking millions or even billions of years to complete. However, certain events like volcanic eruptions can create new rocks relatively quickly on a human timescale.</p>
