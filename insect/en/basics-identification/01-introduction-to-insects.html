        <p class="intro">
            Insects represent more than 80 percent of all described animal species. They pollinate the fruits we buy in
            American grocery stores, aerate Midwestern soils, break down autumn leaf litter in New England, and sustain
            food webs from the Everglades to Yellowstone. Learning the fundamentals of entomology empowers naturalists,
            educators, and curious families to recognize these quiet partners in every habitat.

        <p>
            True insects share a three-part body (head, thorax, abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes,
            and antennae. Most adults also have wings, though groups like fleas and silverfish lost them over evolutionary
            time. Their exoskeleton—a thin but sturdy layer of chitin—acts like natural armor and must be shed each time
            the insect grows, a process called molting.
        </p>
        <p>
            This body plan appears in countless variations. Beetles protect their wings with hardened forewings, while
            dragonflies lock their wings open for high-speed chases. Recognizing the common blueprint beneath that variety
            is the first step in any identification effort.

        <p>
            Pollinators such as native bees, hoverflies, and moths support a third of the food crops grown in the United
            States. Dung beetles keep rangelands cleaner by burying animal waste, reducing fly outbreaks around cattle
            operations. Predatory insects—lady beetles, lacewings, parasitic wasps—act as free pest management in gardens
            and orchards when we avoid unnecessary pesticides.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, insects are ecosystem engineers. Studying them teaches us how water quality, climate shifts, and
            land use decisions ripple through the environment.

        <p>
            Begin with the insects closest to home. Porch lights attract night-flying moths and beetles; milkweed patches
            teem with monarch caterpillars, aphids, and their predators; compost piles reveal decomposers at work. Carry
            a hand lens, take clear photos, and jot down habitat notes. Over time you will notice which species appear in
            spring rains, during hot July evenings, or after the first frost.
        </p>
        <p>
            When identifying, look for three clues: body shape, mouthparts, and wing structure. These features usually
            place an insect into an order (such as Lepidoptera or Coleoptera) even before you know the exact species.
        </p>

            <div class="tip-title">Field Note</div>
            <p>
                Keep a seasonal notebook or digital log. Record the date, location, host plant, temperature, and behavior
                (feeding, mating, migrating). Comparing entries year to year builds a personal database that highlights
                trends such as earlier spring emergence or declines after a drought.
            </p>

        <p class="conclusion">
            Insects may be small, but they offer an enormous portal into ecology, conservation, and climate science. By
            observing them carefully and sharing what you learn with community groups, classrooms, or local land managers,
            you contribute to a growing network of citizen scientists documenting the changing natural world.
