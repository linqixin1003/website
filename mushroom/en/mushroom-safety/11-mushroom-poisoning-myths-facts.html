            <br>
<h2>Introduction: Dangerous Superstition and Deadly Complacent</h2>
<br>
<p>When I first saw someone testing mushroom toxicity with a silver spoon, my blood almost clotting as a mycotologist.The experienced outdoor enthusiast confidently declared, "If the spoon doesn't turn black, it can be eaten safely." What he was preparing to cook was one of North America's deadliest mushrooms - the Death Hat.This scene is repeated every year around the world, and the ending often ends in tragedy.</p>
<br>
<p>Regarding how to identify toxic mushrooms, there are a large number of folk "test methods" and "rules".These superstitions are not only ineffective, but also extremely dangerous.According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, there are more than 7,500 mushroom poisoning reports every year, most of which could have been avoided.What is even more worrying is that mortality rates are significantly higher among immigrant groups, as they tend to carry home identification methods that are not suitable for local fungi.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Quick Tips</strong>: If you can only remember one thing from this article: There is no simple and universal test that can identify poisonous mushrooms.The only reliable method is accurate species-level identification.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why Myths Are So Dangerous: The Fatal Cost of a False Feeling</h2>
<br>
<h3>The root of the problem: Why smart people believe in dangerous myths</h3>
<br>
<p>In my twenty years of mycology research and teaching, I found that even highly educated professionals often fall into the trap of mushroom identification myth.What is the reason?</p>
<br>
<p>The human brain is born to seek pattern recognition and simplified solutions.Facing a complex world of thousands of mushrooms, simple "rules" are extremely attractive.The problem is that mushroom toxicity does not follow the logic of humans—it follows the biochemical complexity of millions of years of evolution.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Real Case</strong>: In 2018, a highly educated family of four in California collected their "confirmed safety" mushrooms in their backyard.They used three different folk test methods: silverware test (not blackened), insect worm test (with wormholes), and color assessment (white, like supermarket mushrooms).Results: Two people died and two people needed a liver transplant.What they accidentally ate was the Angel of Destruction—one of the deadliest mushrooms in North America.</p>
<br>
<h3>Why Myths Persistent: Psychological Traps and Cognitive Bias</h3>
<br>
<p>1. <strong>Confirmation bias</strong>: People only remember cases where "tests work" and victims of failed cases often cannot tell their stories</p>
<br>
<p>2. <strong>Survivor bias</strong>: People who use unsafe methods but are lucky enough not to encounter deadly mushrooms will be wrongly attributed to the effectiveness of the method</p>
<br>
<p>3. <strong>Selective memory</strong>: The brain naturally filters out information that conflicts with existing beliefs</p>
<br>
<p>4. <strong>Social inheritance</strong>: "The wisdom of the elderly" and traditional culture give these myths the authority that they should not have</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Expert recommendation</strong>: Cultivate scientific skepticism.If an identification method sounds too simple to be true, it is likely to be unreliable.</p>
<br>
<h2>A thorough analysis of common dangerous myths</h2>
<br>
<h3>Myth 1: "Silver Blades" Test</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Superficial content</strong>: "Cook silverware (tablespoons, coins) with mushrooms. If it turns black, it will be poisonous, and if it remains unchanged, it will be safe."</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Facts</strong>: Totally wrong and extremely dangerous.This is one of the most dangerous superstitions I encounter in the wild.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Scientific Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p>Silverware discoloration is a simple chemical reaction - silver reacts with sulfide to form black silver sulfide.Some completely non-toxic mushrooms (such as some boletes) contain sulfides that blacken the silverware, while many deadly mushrooms (including death caps and Angel of Destruction) contain no sulfides and do not cause discoloration.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical Case</strong>:</p>
<p>In 2016, a camping group in Washington state used silverware to test it and ate the death cap that would not turn the silverware black.Results: 3 people were hospitalized and 1 person died.An autopsy showed typical Amanitotoxin damage in the victim's liver.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Chemistry</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Silver + Sulfide → Silver Sulfide (Black)</li>
<li>Toxin types: amatoxins, phallotoxins</li>
<li>Chemical Stability: These toxins do not react with silver</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Danger degree</strong>: Extremely high - may cause you to misjudgment the most dangerous mushrooms as safe</p>
<br>
<h3>Myth 2: "Words or animals eat = human safety"</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Superficial content</strong>: "If a bug, slug or animal eats some kind of mushroom, it is safe for humans."</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: This is one of the most dangerous fallacies because it seems to conform to the logic of "natural wisdom".</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Why is wrong</strong>:</p>
<p>The metabolic systems of insects, slugs and mammals are very different from those of humans.Many species can safely metabolize fatal toxins to humans.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Concrete example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Death caps (Amanita phalloides) are often eaten by slugs and insects</li>
<li>Squirrels and deer can safely consume certain amanita that is toxic to humans</li>
<li>Rabbits tolerate relatively high doses of Amanitotoxin</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Physiological Differences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insects lack mammals' liver metabolic pathways</li>
<li>Intestinal flora in some animals can decompose toxins</li>
<li>The difference in weight and metabolic rate significantly affects toxicity</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Expert experience</strong>:</p>
<p>In my field survey, more than 60% of death cap samples showed signs of being gnawed by insects or slugs.Relying on this test is tantamount to Russian roulette.</p>
<br>
<h3>Myth 3: "Bright Color = Poisonous, Dark Color = Safe"</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Superficial content</strong>: "Brightly colored mushrooms are poisonous, and dim colors are safe."</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: There is no reliable correlation between color and toxicity.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Counterexample proof</strong>:</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Bright but edible</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cantharellus cibarius: bright golden yellow, highly sought after delicious</li>
<li>Blood-red rivet mushroom (Chroogomphus rutilus): orange-red, completely edible</li>
<li>Lactarius indigo: bright blue, edible</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Dark but deadly</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Death hat (Amanita phalloides): yellow-green to olive, extremely ordinary appearance</li>
<li>Angel of Destruction (Amanita virosa): pure white, elegant but deadly</li>
<li>Galerina marginata: brown, inconspicuous</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Explanation of Evolutionary Biology</strong>:</p>
<p>Mushroom color is the result of a variety of evolutionary stresses, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photosynthesis organisms (lichen-formed mushrooms)</li>
<li>Camouflage protection</li>
<li>Attract specific communicators</li>
<li>Environmental adaptation</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Toxicity is a chemical defense mechanism, which is different from the evolution path of color.</p>
<br>
<h3>Myth 4: "Cooking can remove all toxins"</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Superficial Content</strong>: "Any mushroom can be eaten safely as long as it is fully cooked."</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: Some of the most dangerous toxins are heat-stable and cannot be destroyed by cooking.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Heat-stabilizing toxin</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amatoxins: resistant to high temperatures, boiling, baking, and pressure cooking without damage</li>
<li>Orellanine: Extreme thermal stability</li>
<li>Certain neurotoxins: For example, Muscarine (Muscarine) partially resistant to heat</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Heat-sensitive toxins</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phallotoxins: Can be destroyed by heat</li>
<li>Certain gastrointestinal irritants: Boiling can remove</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Key Differences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Conditional Edible" Mushrooms: Contain heat-unstable toxins and can be eaten safely after full cooking</li>
<li>"Toxic" mushrooms: Contains heat-stabilizing toxins, and cooking cannot make it safe</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical skills</strong>:</p>
<p>Never rely on cooking to make uncertain mushrooms safe.If the identification is uncertain, discard it directly.</p>
<br>
<h3>Myth 5: "Mushrooms growing on wood are safer than soil"</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Superficial content</strong>: "Milled mushrooms are usually safe, while native mushrooms are more dangerous."</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: Growth matrix has no correlation with toxicity.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Counterexample proof</strong>:</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Mucai but poisonous</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Galerina: Many species of woody, containing deadly amanitotoxin</li>
<li>Inocybe: Some woody species contain muscinine</li>
<li>Lepiota: Some species of woody are poisonous</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Born in native but edible</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boletus edulis: one of the most popular edible fungi</li>
<li>Tuber melanosporum: Top ingredients</li>
<li>Cantharellus cibarius: a popular edible fungus</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Ecological Perspective</strong>:</p>
<p>The growth matrix of mushrooms reflects its nutrient acquisition strategies (saprophytic, parasitological, or mycorrhizal), and is not related to toxic evolution.Toxicity is a chemical defense mechanism and has no direct connection with nutritional methods.</p>
<br>
<h3>Myth 6: "Skinning can remove toxins"</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Superficial content</strong>: "Removing the sterilization cover can remove toxins."</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: In deadly mushrooms, toxins are distributed throughout the fruiting entity.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Scientific facts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amanitotoxin is evenly distributed in the cap, pleat, stalk and trunk</li>
<li>Some toxins are slightly higher in bacterial folds, but the difference is not significant</li>
<li>Peeling can only remove surface impurities and cannot significantly reduce toxicity</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Some correct situation</strong>:</p>
<p>Some edible mushrooms are peeled to improve the taste, not safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slimy slime slime slime slime slime slime slime slime</li>
<li>Edible species of Amanita (expert identification only)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Danger</strong>:</p>
<p>Relying on peeling methods can cause you to accidentally eat 90% toxic mushrooms, which are still fatal.</p>
<br>
<h3>Myth 7: "Bitty = poisonous"</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Superficial content</strong>: "Mushrooms that taste bitter are poisonous, but not bitter."</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: The correlation between bitterness and toxicity is very weak and cannot be relied upon.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Counterexample proof</strong>:</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Bad but relatively safe</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tylopilus falleus: extremely bitter but only causes gastrointestinal discomfort</li>
<li>Certain Lactobacillus: bitter but edible (deemed delicious in some cultures)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Not bitter but fatal</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amanita phalloides: mild taste, even described as "delicious"</li>
<li>Angel of Destruction (Amanita virosa): mild taste</li>
<li>Galerina marginata: The taste is not significant</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Danger of sensory testing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some deadly toxins take hours to show symptoms, but are absorbed when tasting</li>
<li>Even if vomited, the oral mucosa may have absorbed enough toxins</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Expert warns</strong>: Never test unknown mushrooms with taste.The lethal dose of some lethal toxins is extremely small, and it is possible to reach dangerous levels by tasting.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why certain myths are "sometimes effective": Statistical Traps and Cognitive Misconceptions</h2>
<br>
<h3>Selective memory and confirmation bias</h3>
<br>
<p>The human brain naturally tends to find evidence to confirm its beliefs and ignore refuting evidence.This bias is particularly dangerous in mushroom identification.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Real Case Study</strong>:</p>
<p>An experienced collector used the "worm-eater=safety" method for twenty years "never went wrong".Until he moved to a new ecological area, he encountered poisonous mushrooms that local insects could tolerate but humans could not.Results: Acute liver injury, lucky to survive.</p>
<br>
<h3>Generalization of regional knowledge</h3>
<br>
<p>Certain "rules" may work coincidentally among a limited variety in a particular region, but these rules fail when people migrate or encounter new species.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Scientific Explanation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regional restrictions: Some experiences in Europe are not applicable in North America</li>
<li>Species Difference: Similar-looking species may have completely different toxicities</li>
<li>Ecological mutation: The same species may produce different metabolites in different environments</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>The fatal impact of survivor bias</h3>
<br>
<p>Use unsafe methods but lucky people spread them, and the victims' voices are often ignored - because they may be dead or seriously ill.</p>
<br>
<h2>Scientific mushroom identification method: the only reliable way</h2>
<br>
<h3>Basic principles of species-level identification</h3>
<br>
<p>Reliable mushroom identification requires a comprehensive assessment based on multiple characteristics rather than a single simple test.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Required identification features</strong>:</p>
<br>
<p>1. <strong>Macromorphic Characteristics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cap shape, color, texture</li>
<li>Color, density, connection method of bacterial folds</li>
<li>Characteristics of stems: base morphology, whether there is a bacterial ring or a bacterial tray</li>
<li>Overall size and proportion</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>2. <strong>Microscopic features</strong> (if necessary):</p>
<ul>
<li>Spore shape, size, pattern</li>
<li>Body form</li>
<li>Mycelium structure</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>3. <strong>Ecological Information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth matrix (wood, soil type)</li>
<li>Companion plants</li>
<li>Seasons and climatic conditions</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>4. <strong>Chemical Test</strong> (Professional Use):</p>
<ul>
<li>Characteristic color reactions of certain genera</li>
<li>Professional reagent applications</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Spore printing technology: key identification tools</h3>
<br>
<p>Spore printing is one of the most important tools in mushroom identification and underestimated by amateur collectors.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Production Steps</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Take mature but not aging caps</p>
<p>2. Remove the sterilization stem</p>
<p>3. Place the cap folds facing down on half a piece of white paper and half a piece of black paper</p>
<p>4. Cover the bowl and cup to prevent airflow from disturbing</p>
<p>5. Let stand for 2-24 hours</p>
<p>6. Observe the color of the spores</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Spore color classification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>White group: Amanita, Amanitae (including toxic species)</li>
<li>Pink Group: Mushrooms (including edible Agaricus bisporus)</li>
<li>Brown Group: Most Boletus, Scale Umbrella</li>
<li>Black Group: Ghost Umbrella</li>
<li>Purple-brown group: Silkworm</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Practical value</strong>:</p>
<p>Spore printing can immediately eliminate a large number of similar species and is a key step in distinguishing deadly amanita from edible mushrooms.</p>
<br>
<h3>Multiple verification principle</h3>
<br>
<p>Never rely on a single identification feature.Reliable identification requires at least three independent confirmation characteristics.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Verification List</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Spore printing color confirmation</li>
<li>[ ] Base structure inspection (existence or not)</li>
<li>[ ] Bacteria fold connection method</li>
<li>[ ] Ecological consistency</li>
<li>[ ] Comparison with known toxic similar species</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>100% sure principle</h3>
<br>
<p>In mushroom identification, 99% determination equals uncertainty.Any doubt should be considered as a sufficient reason for inedible.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Safety Code</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsure = Not eaten</li>
<li>Eat only a small amount for the first time with a new variety</li>
<li>Keep samples for identification</li>
<li>Never mix and collect unknown species</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Professional tools and equipment suggestions</h2>
<br>
<h3>Basic outdoor equipment</h3>
<br>
<p>1. <strong>Collection basket</strong>: Wicker basket allows spores to spread and avoid premature rot caused by plastic bags</p>
<p>2. <strong>Little Knife</strong>: Used to fully dig mushrooms and check the base structure</p>
<p>3. <strong>Brush</strong>: Clean mushrooms without destroying characteristics</p>
<p>4. <strong>Wild Guide</strong>: Regional-specific, scientific mushroom picture illustration</p>
<p>5. <strong>Notebook</strong>: Record the collection location, date and habitat information</p>
<br>
<h3>Advanced authentication tool</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Handheld Magnifier</strong>: 10x magnifier for observing subtle features</p>
<p>2. <strong>Spore printing materials</strong>: black and white paper, cup and bowl</p>
<p>3. <strong>Chemical reagents</strong> (optional): KOH, FeSO4, etc. are used for professional identification</p>
<p>4. <strong>Microscopy</strong>: Home laboratory level, 400 times sufficient spore observation</p>
<br>
<h3>Digital Tools and Resources</h3>
<br>
<ul>
<li>iNaturalist and other citizen science platforms</li>
<li>Identification services of the Regional Fungal Society</li>
<li>Online resources for the University's Department of Mycologics</li>
<li>Scientific Literature Database</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Real Case Study: When Myth meets reality</h2>
<br>
<h3>Case 1: Fatal failure of silverware test</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: An experienced outdoor family in Colorado in 2019</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Event</strong>: They collected seemingly delicious mushrooms in the forest and tested them with family-owned silverware.The spoon has not turned black and they can eat it with confidence.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: After 12 hours, the whole family developed severe vomiting and diarrhea.Three days later, the two developed liver failure.The identification confirmed that they had consumed the death cap.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: Death caps contain no sulfide and will not turn silverware black.This family-dependent test is totally ineffective at the most dangerous mushrooms.</p>
<br>
<h3>Case 2: Wrong confidence in worm-eater judgment</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: A collector who considers himself experienced</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Observation</strong>: He found obvious signs of insect worms on mushrooms, and believed that "worms can eat them, but people can eat them."</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Result</strong>: Severely poisoned, hospitalized for one week.What he accidentally ate was the poisonous silkworm that was often tolerated by specific insects.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: The metabolic differences between insects and humans make this judgment extremely unreliable.</p>
<br>
<h3>Case 3: Intercultural Risks of Immigration Experience</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: Immigrant families from Eastern Europe, with experience collecting their hometowns</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: They believe that North American mushrooms are similar to their hometowns, using the traditional "boiling and detoxification" method</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Trama</strong>: Multiple boils cannot remove amanita toxin, the whole family was poisoned, and one person died</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: Regional knowledge cannot be applied across regions, local bacteria must be learned</p>
<br>
<h2>Education and Prevention Strategies</h2>
<br>

<br>
<h2>Emergency treatment guide for poisoning</h2>
<br>
<h3>Identify symptoms of poisoning</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Early Symptoms (2-24 hours)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</li>
<li>Abdominal pain, spasms</li>
<li>Sweating, salivating</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Delayed symptoms (6-48 hours)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporary relief of symptoms (dangerous illusion of safety)</li>
<li>Signs of liver damage: jaundice, dark urine</li>
<li>Symptoms of renal failure</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Emergency response steps</h3>
<br>
<p>1. <strong>Go to medical treatment now</strong>: Don't wait for the symptoms to appear</p>
<p>2. <strong>Reserve sample</strong>: Bring leftover mushrooms for identification</p>
<p>3. <strong>Don't try home remedies</strong>: Do not induce vomiting (unless directed by a doctor)</p>
<p>4. <strong>Contact Poison Control Center</strong>: 1-800-222-1222</p>
<p>5. <strong>Providing details</strong>: Intake time, quantity, and symptom development</p>
<br>
<h3>Medical treatment progress</h3>
<br>
<p>Modern medicine has made significant progress in the treatment of mushroom poisoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Silymarin: an effective antidote for amanita poisoning</li>
<li>Activated Carbon: Early use can reduce toxin absorption</li>
<li>Liver Support Therapy: Including N-acetylcysteine</li>
<li>Severe case: Liver transplant can save lives</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion: Knowledge is life</h2>
<br>
<p>Myths and superstitions about mushroom toxicity are not only ineffective, but also dangerously deadly.Silverware testing, insect worm-eater judgment, color rules - these cannot reliably identify poisonous mushrooms.The only reliable method is scientific species-level identification based on multiple characteristics, supported by knowledge and experience.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Key Action Points</strong>:</p>
<br>
<p>1. <strong>Total abandon</strong>all civil testing methods</p>
<p>2. <strong>System learning</strong>Scientific identification technology</p>
<p>3. <strong>Join the community</strong>Look for mentors and experts</p>
<p>4. <strong>Conservative practice</strong>Never eat it if you are uncertain</p>
<p>5. <strong>Continuing Education</strong>Mytologics is a lifelong learning field</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Finally Recommended</strong>:</p>
<p>If someone tells you a "easy way" to identify poisonous mushrooms, be highly suspicious.There are no shortcuts in mycologic, but the time you invest in your study may save the lives of you and your loved ones.</p>
<br>
<p>Remember this wild collector's motto: "No mushroom is worth tasting with life." Reject myths, embrace science, and protect life - this is the solemn promise of responsible mushroom collectors.</p>

<br>
<h3>Mushroom consumption risk warning</h3>
<br>
<p>1. <strong>Life safety first</strong>: There are inherent risks in the identification of wild mushrooms.Many toxic mushrooms look very similar to edible mushrooms, and accidentally ingesting them can lead to serious illness or even death.</p>
<br>
<p>2. <strong>Professional identification required</strong>: Before eating any wild mushrooms, 100% confirmation must be performed by a professional mycologist or certified mushroom identification expert.Photos, text descriptions and personal experience are not sufficient to ensure safety.</p>
<br>
<p>3. <strong>Individual Differences</strong>: Even recognized edible mushrooms may cause adverse reactions due to factors such as personal constitution, allergic reactions, consumption method or mushroom growth environment.Try in small quantities when eating a new variety for the first time.</p>
<br>
<p>4. <strong>Geographical differences</strong>: There are huge differences in mushroom species and toxicity in different regions.The information mentioned in this article may not apply to your region.Please consult local mycology experts and authoritative organizations.</p>
<br>
<p>5. <strong>Professional Responsibility</strong>: The author and the publisher shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damage, disease or loss arising from the use of the information in this article.</p>

<h3>Safety advice</h3>
<br>
<ul>
<li>✅ Participate in formal mushroom identification training courses</li>
<li>✅ Join the local mycology association or mushroom club</li>
<li>✅ Purchase cultivated mushrooms from reliable sources</li>
<li>✅ Save mushroom samples for emergency medical needs</li>
<li>✅ Do not eat it if you have any doubts</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Remember: When you have any questions, the only safe option is not to eat it.Your life safety is far more important than any mushroom meal.</strong></p>
