        <h2 class="article-title">Insects as Engines of Energy Flow</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            In every prairie, forest, wetland, and backyard in the United States, insects move energy from plants into
            the broader food web. They clip leaves, sip sap, hunt one another, and break down dead material. Seeing
            insects as herbivores, predators, and decomposers helps explain why changes in their populations ripple
            through entire ecosystems.

        <p>
            Plant‑eating insects convert sunlight stored in leaves and seeds into biomass that birds, reptiles, and small
            mammals can use. Caterpillars on oak trees, aphids on milkweed, and grasshoppers in Midwestern fields all
            channel plant energy upward. Different feeding styles—chewing, mining, gall‑forming, or sap‑sucking—affect
            plant growth in distinct ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moderate herbivory can even stimulate new growth or increase plant diversity, but heavy outbreaks, especially
            in simplified agricultural systems, may lead to noticeable defoliation or crop loss.

        <p>
            Predatory insects such as lady beetles, lacewings, assassin bugs, and dragonflies help keep herbivore numbers
            in check. Parasitoid wasps lay eggs in or on other insects; their larvae consume the host from within, a key
            natural control on many agricultural pests. When landscapes lose flowering plants, hedgerows, or wetlands,
            these beneficial insects often decline, allowing herbivore populations to surge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Observing who eats whom in your garden—aphids on stems, lady beetles hunting them, birds gleaning beetles—
            reveals a layered food web rather than a simple pest story.

        <p>
            Dung beetles, carrion beetles, soldier fly larvae, and countless other insects break down dead plants and
            animals. In doing so, they return nutrients to the soil, improve structure, and support microbial communities.
            On rangelands in the American West, for example, dung beetles quickly bury cattle manure, reducing parasite
            loads and fly breeding sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            In forests, wood‑boring beetle larvae and termites help logs decompose, creating habitat for fungi and mosses
            and releasing nutrients that feed new tree growth.
        </p>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <div class="tip-title">Field Note</div>
            <p>
                When you survey a site, try to record at least one herbivore, one predator or parasitoid, and one decomposer.
                Noting their interactions—such as beetles under fallen logs or wasps visiting aphid colonies—builds a
                richer picture of how energy moves through that small patch of ground.

        <p class="conclusion">
            Recognizing insects as key players in food webs shifts the focus from individual “pest” species to whole
            ecological networks. This perspective supports more nuanced conservation and land‑management decisions, from
            backyard plantings to large‑scale restoration projects.
