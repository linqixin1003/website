            <h1>Metamorphic Rocks: Formation, Types, and Characteristics</h1>
            
            <p>Metamorphic rocks are one of the three main types of rocks, alongside igneous and sedimentary rocks. They form when existing rocks (igneous, sedimentary, or even other metamorphic rocks) undergo profound changes due to intense heat, pressure, and chemical reactions without melting completely. This process, known as metamorphism, transforms the original rock's mineralogy, texture, and structure, creating entirely new rock types with unique properties.</p>

            <h2>How Metamorphic Rocks Form</h2>
            
            <p>Metamorphism occurs when rocks are subjected to conditions significantly different from those in which they originally formed. The primary agents of metamorphism are:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heat:</strong> Generated by geothermal gradient, magma intrusion, or friction along fault zones</li>
                <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> Confining pressure from overlying rocks and differential stress from tectonic forces</li>
                <li><strong>Chemical fluids:</strong> Primarily water and carbon dioxide, which facilitate mineral reactions and recrystallization</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Metamorphism</h2>
            
            <div class="metamorphic-types">
                <div class="metamorphic-type-card">
                    <h3>Regional Metamorphism</h3>
                    <p>Occurs over large areas due to tectonic activity, particularly at convergent plate boundaries. Characterized by high pressure and moderate to high temperature.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="metamorphic-type-card">
                    <h3>Contact Metamorphism</h3>
                    <p>Occurs when rocks come into contact with magma or lava. Limited to small areas around igneous intrusions, with high temperature but low pressure.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="metamorphic-type-card">
                    <h3>Hydrothermal Metamorphism</h3>
                    <p>Occurs when hot, chemically active fluids interact with rocks. Common in volcanic areas and mid-ocean ridges.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="metamorphic-type-card">
                    <h3>Dynamic Metamorphism</h3>
                    <p>Occurs along fault zones where rocks are subjected to intense mechanical deformation and shearing.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Classification of Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
            
            <p>Metamorphic rocks are classified based on their texture (foliation) and mineral composition:</p>
            
            <h3>Foliated Metamorphic Rocks</h3>
            <p>These rocks have a layered or banded appearance due to the alignment of minerals under pressure:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Slate:</strong> Fine-grained, splits easily into thin sheets, formed from shale or mudstone</li>
                <li><strong>Phyllite:</strong> Intermediate between slate and schist, with a silky sheen</li>
                <li><strong>Schist:</strong> Medium to coarse-grained, with visible platy minerals like mica</li>
                <li><strong>Gneiss:</strong> Coarse-grained, with distinct light and dark mineral bands</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Non-Foliated Metamorphic Rocks</h3>
            <p>These rocks lack a layered structure, typically forming from uniform pressure or non-platy minerals:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marble:</strong> Formed from limestone or dolomite, composed mainly of calcite or dolomite</li>
                <li><strong>Quartzite:</strong> Formed from sandstone, composed mainly of quartz</li>
                <li><strong>Anthracite:</strong> High-grade metamorphic coal, hard and shiny</li>
                <li><strong>Hornfels:</strong> Fine-grained rock formed by contact metamorphism of various parent rocks</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Metamorphic Grade</h2>
            
            <p>Metamorphic rocks are also classified by their metamorphic grade, which indicates the intensity of metamorphism:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Low-grade metamorphism:</strong> Occurs at lower temperatures and pressures, resulting in rocks like slate and phyllite</li>
                <li><strong>Medium-grade metamorphism:</strong> Occurs at moderate temperatures and pressures, resulting in rocks like schist</li>
                <li><strong>High-grade metamorphism:</strong> Occurs at high temperatures and pressures, resulting in rocks like gneiss and migmatite (a rock with both metamorphic and igneous characteristics)</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Metamorphic Rocks and Plate Tectonics</h2>
            
            <p>Metamorphic rocks are closely associated with plate tectonic processes. Most metamorphism occurs at convergent plate boundaries where tectonic forces generate immense pressure and heat. For example:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Regional metamorphism is common in mountain-building zones at convergent boundaries</li>
                <li>Hydrothermal metamorphism occurs at divergent boundaries like mid-ocean ridges</li>
                <li>Dynamic metamorphism happens along transform boundaries and fault zones</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Economic Importance of Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
            
            <p>Metamorphic rocks have significant economic value:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marble:</strong> Used in construction, sculpture, and decorative applications</li>
                <li><strong>Slate:</strong> Used for roofing, flooring, and billiard tables</li>
                <li><strong>Quartzite:</strong> Used as a building material and abrasive</li>
                <li><strong>Metamorphic deposits:</strong> Host for valuable minerals like gold, silver, and gemstones</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Studying Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
            
            <p>Geologists study metamorphic rocks to understand Earth's thermal and tectonic history. By analyzing mineral assemblages, textures, and structures, they can determine the pressure-temperature conditions under which the rocks formed. This information helps reconstruct past geological events and processes.</p>
